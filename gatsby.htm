A food steeped in culture and worshipped by loyal subjects who will defend its integrity to the last. At its simplest it is a long baguette filled with chips, salad and polony, or it could be a hot delicious mess layered with salty slap chips, crisp salad, cape Malay style saucy masala steak/viennas/polony, fried eggs and sticky finger-licking sauces. </p><p>It is a food of the people and difficult to lay claim to its origin. Rashad Pandy, who is the owner of <strong>Super Fisheries</strong>  in Athlone is reputed to be the original creator in 1976. He had to feed a group of labourers who had done some work for him. Not having much at hand he took a round Portuguese bread, cut it open and filled it with chips, polony and atchar. It was a hit and one of the labourers called it a Gatsby Smash, with reference to The Great Gatsby which was playing in cinemas at the time. Pandy tried it on his customers in his takeaway, and the rest is history.</p><p>You cannot visit Cape Town without hitting at least one from this list.

The original recipe is made in a 23cm round cake tin, but I made it in 2 loaf tins. It’s perfect on the side of a good cup of coffee and equally good with some Karak chai.

What do you think of this flavour combo? Would you make it? 🌸

Coffee and Cardamom Cake
Ingredients
200g butter, softened
200g caster sugar
4 large eggs
2 tsp strong Instant coffee mixed with 3 Tbsp hot water
8 cardamom pods, seeds removed and ground or 1,5 tsp ground cardamom
250g self-raising flour

Filling
250g fresh cream
1 Tbsp icing sugar
5 cardamom pods, seeds removed and ground or 1/2 tsp ground cardamom

Icing
110g icing sugar
1/2 tsp strong Instant coffee mixed with 1-2 Tbsp warm water
Method

Preheat the oven to 190C/375F/Gas 5.
Grease and line a 23cm deep cake tin or 2 loaf tins.
Place the butter and sugar into a bowl and whisk until light and fluffy.
Add the eggs, one at a time, beating between each addition until well incorporated.
Add the coffee and ground cardamom seeds and mix well, then fold in the flour.

Pour the mixture into the round cake tin or 2 loaf tins, transfer to the oven and bake for 20-25 minutes if in the round tin or 15-22 minutes in the loaf tins, or until golden-brown and well risen. Remove from the oven and allow to cool.

For the filling, place the cream into a bowl with the icing sugar and cardamom and whisk gently until the mixture forms firm peaks.

For the icing, place the icing sugar into a bowl, add the coffee and 1 Tbsp water and mix together until smooth. If it’s too thick add the other Tbsp water a few drops at a time.

To assemble, cut the cake in half horizontally. Spread the cream over the bottom half of the cake, then top with the other half. Spoon over the icing, allowing it to drizzle down the sides of the cake. Add a sprinkle of pistachios before the icing sets.

I was literally gob-smacked this week when I visited Clifton Mall on Fountain street to try out the Lounge at Clifton restaurant. This fresh, bright and modern space has been around for 2 years and we had no clue!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The mall itself is a block over from the Oriental Plaza, but inside you would think you were in a completely different neighbourhood. The skylight in the mall roof lets in lots of natural light and the white and glass finishes brightens the inside of the mall. They have secure underground parking and 3 floors of retail space with the restaurant on the 2<sup>nd<\/sup> floor. Most of the stores were electronics or cellphone shops with a few selling clothing, perfumes and carpets. There is more retail space available and they are taking on tenants.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The restaurant on the top floor is large and spacious. Floor to ceiling windows let in lots of light and affords a view over the Plaza with lots of trees below and the city in the background. There is plenty of space between tables though I felt they could add more tables and d\u00e9cor elements to create a more intimate environment. There is also comfy armchair seating around coffee tables at the front of the restaurant. Perfect for dessert and coffee if you\u2019re not having a meal.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Misbah Ahmed, who owns the restaurant welcomed us warmly and seated us in comfortable high backed dining chairs before bringing out a selection of dishes for us to try. The menu is Indo-Pak as well as some Chinese dishes with the chef being Indian, from Hyderabad. We were offered Mutton Nihari, Tikka Chicken, Arabic Mandi, Chicken Karahi and light and crispy Naan. But the show stopper was the Malai Tikka Sizzler. Tender marinated pieces of chicken on a bed of peppers and sliced onions presented on a sizzling cast iron skillet with the added drama of dry-ice smoke at your table. Besides being visually enticing it was also utterly delicious.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The Nihari with a thick gravy and tender pieces of mutton was very tasty although I felt it could have been spicier. The Chicken Karahi was also tasty albeit also on the mild side. We really enjoyed the Arabic Mandi. This was a quarter Tandoori Chicken served on a bed of flavourful rice topped with crispy fried onions. There was a thin green yoghurt-based sauce on the side which added moisture. Although it was very enjoyable even without the sauce as the rice was flavourful and not dry at all.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Accompanying our meal, we were offered the new Salaam Cola drinks. I was happy to learn that they are not serving Coca Cola based drinks in the restaurant. They are also official distributers for Salaam Cola in South Africa. If you haven\u2019t yet heard of Salaam Cola, they are an alternative soda option that donates 10% of all proceeds to charity.<br>Salaam Cola Original - 10% Proceeds go to Palestine \ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\uddf8<br>Seriously No Sugar Cola - 10% Proceeds go to Syria \ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfe<br>Yemenade Lemon\/Lime - 10% Proceeds go to Yemen \ud83c\uddfe\ud83c\uddea<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Their drinks menu is bigger than most. They have a variety of coffees, frios, shakes and hot chocolate. They offer milk alternatives like almond, oat, coconut or soy. They even customize your latte with the addition of Collagen powder, Functional Mushroom, CBD powder and syrups.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Dessert is a very small menu and we shared a serving a of gulab jamun. While I\u2019m not usually a fan, this was a perfectly sweet ending to our meal. Actually, I forgot to mention the Desi Masala Tea. THAT was the perfect ending. Boiled until rich, creamy with just the right amount of masala and at R15 a cup, ridiculously cheap. I found the prices to be reasonable, and in most cases, cheaper than other restaurants serving a similar menu.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Service could use a little bit of attention.

We chose a pomegranate and watermelon mocktail, a fruit cocktail made with layers of fresh pressed juices and milk and Taufeeq of course went with the Oreo milkshake. For the son of a foodie he has very predictable tastes in drinks and ice cream. I\u2019m working on that\u2026<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The name \u201cNarang\u201d derives from the rich history of the <a href=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/collectionlisting\/middle-eastern\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Middle East<\/a>. There it is used to describe the characteristic bitter orange trees, whose scent and fruit spread across Iraq, Iran and Syria. In Syria, especially in Damascus, the Naranj tree is a symbol of hospitality, often found in the courtyards of traditional houses.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The d\u00e9cor at Narang is warm and casual. A huge colourful mural of middle eastern streets and interiors cover a wall in front of which 2 comfy yellow couches and coffee tables stand ready for patrons to settle with a coffee and dessert. Sturdy natural wood and white tables are ideal for comfortable family meals and an outside patio area overlooks the street where you can watch the cars go by while enjoying a hubbly.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For starters we opted for a meze of Pesto Hummus, different from any I have had. It was a green colour due to the addition of a herb pesto. We had Aton which is a dip made with roasted red pepper, tomato, olive oil and walnuts. We really enjoyed the delicious smokey flavour scooped up with the generous laffa bread. Our waiter also suggested we try the falafel. These were the lightest falafels I have ever tasted with a perfectly crisp coating. They were easy to eat and not stodgy at all as I have found at some other places.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For mains Taufeeq had the chicken shawarma which comes cut up and served with salad and fries. I liked that the fries are a crinkle cut slice and not your standard fries. Zulfi ordered the Narnj Burger which comes with a beef patty and smoked meats on top. This was a generous burger but the bun was too soft and the burger broke apart while eating it. A sturdier roll like a brioche would be better for this meaty burger.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I had the Spicy Rizo, which is a rice dish with crumbed chicken. I looks a bit like Biryani at first glance but is quite different. It comes with a side of 3 different sauces, yoghurt, a spicy orange sauce and something more sweet. Looked like tomato sauce but it wasn\u2019t. What I liked about this dish was all the different and unexpected textures. There\u2019s the crispy crumbed chicken fillet pieces, the soft rice and there\u2019s also bits of fried crunchy pita chips in between. It\u2019s not too spicy so it was tasty while being easy to eat.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Syrian restaurants have a focus on fresh fruit-based drinks and Narang offered a nice selection of these. They are like a fruit milkshake as they also contain milk. The date and avo was calling my name but will have to wait for my next visit. Special mention for the pomegranate and watermelon mocktail which was not fizzy and just sweet enough with a hint of tartness from the pomegranate.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The average price of a meal is about R110, though the burger was R150 and a grill platter is about R240. It has an easy and relaxed vibe and a great spot to while away a Sunday afternoon with authentic Syrian flavours.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->","post_title":"Narang Restaurant, Parktown North","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"naranj-restaurant-parktown-north","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2024-10-24 10:47:36","post_modified_gmt":"2024-10-24 08:47:36","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/?post_type=listing&#038;p=17660","menu_order":0,"post_type":"listing","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},{"ID":17647,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2024-10-03 20:45:23","post_date_gmt":"2024-10-03 18:45:23","post_content":"<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In the heart of Damascus, where ancient alleyways whisper tales of time gone by, and the scent of spices dances through the vibrant souks, Syrian life, food and culture unfolds in a tapestry of rich and cherished traditions... Fast forward to the bustling streets of downtown Johannesburg in the midst of Fordsburg, and you'll find the flavours of Damascus at Syrian Rose Restaurant.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A Syrian run business, they have been around since 2021. It's a simple spot set on the corner of Albertina Sisulu and Mint Raod, a step up from street level. There are a few tables inside and balcony seating outside along the outside from where you can watch people and taxis passing by. We spotted <a href=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/listing\/alcazaba-lodge-fordsburg\/\">Alcazaba Lodge<\/a>, which is a halaal hotel right next door.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We tried them out on a Saturday afternoon for a quick lunch. It wasn't too busy but it was nice to note that the crowd inside was diverse. The service was speedy and friendly. The menu is kept fairly simple and the food is hearty but well priced. They also make their own fresh juices and fruit shakes. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We opted for the Beef Hummus plate and the Chicken Shawarma meal, and a side of Kibbeh, which is minced meat in a coating of Bulghar wheat and deep fried. The Beef Hummus plate comes with shredded Beef Shawarma meat on a bed of hummus with red onion and tahini sauce and handmade laffa (Syrian bread). <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The laffa is made at the front of the store in the traditional way. The chef pulling and stretching the dough and tossing it in the air when foodies like me come to take a photo. It is stretched over a cotton pillow and then turned onto a hot steel plate to quickly bubble up and tossed onto the growing pile once cooked. These are made fresh and I couldn't help thinking the poor guy who has to spend the whole day making laffa must have it coming out of his ears by the end of the day.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I used pieces of laffa to assemble my hummus and meat on, added some onion and tahini and tucked in. It's not spicy, and I felt the hummus needed more flavour but the tahini and onions made this very enjoyable. The Chicken Shawarma on the other hand had plenty of flavour. It comes with chips, garlic sauce and crunchy red cabbage, onions and tomato. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>While their avo and date shake is popular we opted for the fresh orange juice and pineapple juice. A refreshing choice to offset the sticky heat of the afternoon and round off our <a href=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/listing\/damascus-sea-point\/\">Syrian<\/a> experience.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Our shawarma meals averaged about R130 each, but they also serve grilled chicken which is priced much lower.

As the weeks drew out towards their opening I was left wondering if they would actually deliver on this promise. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So instead of having a huge opening bash as has become the norm with many restaurants, they have quietly opened with a soft launch last week. This allows them to make sure everything is working as it should and iron out any teething issues before they get the crowds.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Unable to resist the glamorous promise from their Instagram page I went to try them out this week rather than wait as I usually do for the hype to die down. And I must say, they have delivered on that promise. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Located in the LXX Sandhurst Shopping Centre, a newly opened luxury shopping complex, the restaurant is a masterpiece of marble surfaces, luxurious fabrics, crystal chandeliers and polished finishes. No expense has been spared to bring you a space ideal for birthdays, celebrations or romantic interludes. The only downside is that the restaurant entrance is on the Basement parking level. So if you're wanting to impress your date, park on the ground level and take the lift 1 level down (you could take the stairs, but she's probably wearing some killer heels) so you don't have to walk her through the parking level into the restaurant. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We had made a reservation for an early lunch and were warmly welcomed and seated at a table of our choice as they are still too new to be busy. The host offered tasting portions of Turkish delight from the dessert display. A fitting way to start our Turkish meal with traditional Lokkum Rolls in a variety of flavours which I first tasted in <a href=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/2022\/07\/turkey-travels-exploring-istanbul-1\/\">Istanbul<\/a> 2 years ago and has slowly made its way to South Africa. We ordered some mocktails while we waited for our mains and then realised the spot we chose near the wall was too noisy due to the construction happening outside as they are still building their outdoor area.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We moved to the beautiful extended \"Shongololo\" (centipede) style couch along which several 2-seater tables were arranged. There were semi-circular booths available as well but it seemed greedy to monopolise an 8 seater for just the 2 of us. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>My rose mocktail was refreshing and the pink rose flavoured Monin syrup had a delightful flavour profile unlike that of the rose syrups we use for falooda. My friend Amina had the watermelon daquiri which came lusciously piled up in a shallow daquiri glass. I noted also that the glassware and serveware is of the finest quality. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Mosso restaurant is from the same stable as <a href=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/listing\/istanbul-kebab-sunninghill\/\">Istanbul Kebab<\/a>, so the menu was very similar but presentation is just that bit extra. You can expect Meze, Pides, Turkish grills, sotes, wraps and burgers. They have a very small selection of vegetarian, mainly falafel dishes. Other vegetarian options come from the Meze. The milkshake selection looked decadent and the usual Turkish suspects on the dessert menu ie. Baklava, Sutlac and Kunefe, with the addition of a Trilices and Waffle.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We ordered their Onion Flower which I first had at <a href=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/2022\/07\/turkey-travels-exploring-istanbul-part-2\/\">Nusret<\/a> restaurant in Turkey. This battered fried onion concept at R140 looks like a blooming flower and has great visual appeal adding drama to your meal. The waiter brings it to your table and proceeds to cut it into portions to be shared. It is certainly way too much for one person. We also ordered the Mixed Platter for 1 at R350, which comes with 2 additional options that you can choose from the Meze menu, a flatbread, fries or rice and a selection of kebab, lamb chops and chicken. It was more than enough for 2 of us. It is served in a small baine marie which was ideal to keep the food warm as this was not a quick lunch. The dish is very hot so be careful when touching it as I found out to my detriment trying to maneauver it to just the right angle for a photo. The waiter was quick to come over and move it for me instead.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Service was excellent. The waiters were well trained and attentive. Serviettes were replaced and dishes cleared almost without us even noticing. Another friend joined us for dessert and after some deliberation over the whopping R200 price tag she opted for the waffle, all of us curious to know what to expect. Amina and I shared a plate of chocolate baklava which was 4 pieces for R140. A bit too sweet for me and the chocolate flavour was lacking. Dessert for us was a bit underwhelming. The waffle was a single round waffle topped with slices of fruit and smarties. The smarties did not elevate this dish. Neither of the desserts came with a side of cream or ice cream which would have completed the plates somewhat.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>What I really liked was the private room which is ideal for small celebrations or private dining. It can seat 16 people and can be completely closed from the rest of the restaurant. There is even a buzzer that can be used to summon a waiter if needed. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Just outside the restaurant, salaah rooms are available separately for men and women with each having their own ablution facilties as well.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Mosso is pricey and considering the ambiance and the fact that they don't have a childrens menu, I would leave the kids at home.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The outside area they say will be something to really talk about.

We popped in one afternoon for lunch without a reservation and were accomodated easily as they were not busy.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The setting is a throwback to 1930's lounge decor. A cross between old world style and modern finishes. Slick marble tabletops contast with plush floral printed upholstered dining chairs and modern lighting. The waiters are outfitted in dapper pinstripes with waistcoats, complete with bowler hats. You feel a bit like you're in a mobster movie, which is great for a bit of escapism from the daily grind.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Our waiter was very efficient and knowlegable of the menu. We ordered a mushroom starter to share and mocktails while we waited for our mains and I must add that the mushroom starter gets extra points as it came artfully presented in an unusual egg box style plate. It was substantial and easily shared amongst the three of us. The accompanying sauce tangy and flavourful.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Our mains took a bit of time. My Firecracker Prawn Pasta was exceptional. The flavour spicy and creamy with just enough heat. The portion was generous and I ended up taking some home. Zulfi had the Butter Chicken which comes with rice and naan. I felt the double carbs was overkill and one of the carbs could rather be substituted for a veg. At R230 I also felt the portion of curry was quite small.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Taufeeq had the <a href=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/2018\/01\/find-best-tikka-chicken-country\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Tikka Chicken<\/a> cubes. This came with chips and naan as well and a small salad garnish. The chicken breast cubes were tender and coated in sauce which was spicy and tangy. This was very tasty and priced at R150. Our drinks both milkshake and mocktail came in the trending mocca style cocktail glasses. I'm not normally a cream soda girl but my orange and cream soda flavoured <a href=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/2015\/11\/mocking-cocktail-how-to-make-perfect\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">mocktail<\/a> actually went down really well.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We had to try some dessert and opted to share a rasmalai flavoured kheer dessert. I must admit I appreciated the presentation of this pudding which is normally served in a bowl. Moulded into a flower form with a side of ice cream and slight drizzle of rose flavoured syrup, it was a delight. The cardamom flavour shone through and pistachio shards added a bit of crunch.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This was an expensive lunch and came in at R1200 for the 3 of us. It's not a place I'd head to randomly or take the kids. It's a good spot for special occasions and date nights.

It was a challenge getting parking nearby but we got lucky when someone was leaving and our roadside parking attendant aka \"car guard\" as only South Africans will understand, ushered us in.  <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The restaurant is small and cosy and Ashraf welcomed us in from behind the counter. We were seated and he went to close the front doors to minimise the noise from the adjoining restaurants and bars.

I was immediately sold by the warmth and hospitality from this couple. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Nuri explained the menu to us as the names of the dishes were mostly in Indonesian. Some of them I recognised as I had travelled in Malaysia years ago, but the explanation was a good refresher.

Nuri had a special dish available called Nasi Padang (an Indonesian complete traditional meal). It comprises Jack Fruit Curry, Red &amp; Green Sambal, Omelete, Boil Casava Leaf and Jasmine Rice. with a choice of Beef Rendang R160, Fish in Red Sauce R150 or Grilled Chicken R140. I hadn't had Jack Fruit curry since my time in Malawi 20 years ago and jumped at the chance to try it again. This dish was a treat of flavours and textures. The beef was tender and spicy and the jack fruit curry balanced the heat very well. There was also a red and green chilli paste both of which were tasty and not burn-your-pants-off hot. The casava chips were delicious.  <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Zulfi had the Coconut Soup with chicken and sprouts which was milder but also very tasty and came with a portion of rice at R130. Taufeeq chickened out and ordered the strips and chips but opted for the spicy version. They were good but he found them too spicy and could not finish them. We also ordered a portion of sweetcorn cakes which was meant as a starter but came with the main meal. We didn't enjoy these so much and found them a bit heavy.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I tried a traditional home made iced tea with basil seeds.

It's basic with little effort made for ambiance. The purple tablecloths with Indian print gave a cursory nod to the subcontinent. But it's clean enough and staff are speedy.

The flavour was good but I found it a little thick. One bowl serves about 4 people so it's generous for R99. The steak sizzler with the creamy sauce at R145 was amazing, the steak perfectly done. I wanted to try something different so I went for the Chicken Chop Suey which comes with Crispy Noodles. It was ok, I found it a little bland and wouldn't order this again. Taufeeq's Bunny Chow was tasty, and Zulfi enjoyed the Keema Curry with really good naan. Their aloo paratha was also really good and flavourful. The dishes were spicy but not overly hot. I also had a Bombay Crush but can say that I have had better. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I found the prices more affordable than most other restaurants of the same kind.

It's not meant for languid dinners that stretch out for hours, the basic wooden seating is not forgiving enough on your bottom. Rather it is a brief stop to assuage that craving for authentic Vietnamese flavours and dishes. The small space houses about 4 tables from where you can see the food being prepared behind the counter. The cashier is also the waitress and for drinks you can help yourself from the soda fridge.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>They are situated next to Khao Hom Halaal Asian Grocer.

It is served with lettuce and greens which you add to the broth and allow to wilt before eating. Like ramen it's not easy to eat noodle broth with a spoon. You need chopsticks for the noodles and a spoon for the broth. It was tasty and warming though, perfect to offset the winter chill. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The chicken fried rice was moist and filling. We also had the chicken dumplings perfectly charred and tasty. The prawn Vietnamese spring rolls for me was the stand-out. Crunchy veg and prawn encased in rice wrappers with the tastiest dipping sauces of peanut satay and soy. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Prices average about R80 for starters and R150 for mains. It's not cheap but with rental prices in Cape Town being what it is eating out is also becoming increasingly expensive.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To end off the Vietnamese coffee was the perfect finale. It's served in a glass with a shot of condensed milk at the bottom over which is placed a Vietnamese Pour Over Filter through which your coffee slowly drips.

Buyuk Chamilja Farm, or as they call it, a Socio Eco Techno Village run by a Turkish organization - UICT, is a good example of the kind of investment that the Turkish community is making in South Africa. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This olive and fig farm is a fantastic child-friendly venue for a day in the sun with lots of activities for the kids as well as good food and an atmosphere to unwind and enjoy the weekend.

A tiny cubby-hole by comparison. It is just large enough to fit 3 tables inside and 2 more on the sidewalk. But its intimacy lends itself to sweet hospitality which we experienced when we went for a late lunch on a Sunday just before Ramadaan.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We weren't able to book ahead as they don't have a phone number for the restaurant as yet. So we took a chance and just drove through. On arriving we found the restaurant was empty, which is not surprising for a Sunday, though I think during the week they would be busier. We were welcomed by a Turkish man in an ethnic embroidered waistcoat. After seating us we were offered little complementary cups of cold sherbet with notes of rose, clove and cardamom along with nuggets of Turkish Delight.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>While waiting for our food I explored the shelves of imported Turkish teacup sets, coffee and flavoured teas. They also have a range of their own sauces and condiments. A decorative tea cart with a well for sand to make their traditional coffee which is heated and brought to boil in the hot sand, stood in one corner. It seemed to be more for aesthetics than to be in actual use. Perhaps it is taken out on occasion. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The menu is is not huge with a selection of pides, meze, a few selected main meals and Turkish wraps. We chose a chicken pide, the Iskender and a Beef Donner. Except for the pide, all the meals were extremely generous. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The Iskender at R220 is slivers of beef atop a layer of cubed bread made in-house, topped with a tomato based sauce and then drizzled with hot butter at the table. This was delicious but too much for one person. The Beef Donner at R135 comprised of layers of shawarma meat and salad inside their homemade bread, which is the size of perhaps two rolls. Another dish that is quite shareable. Both came with fries. Our waitress was pleasant and efficient but could have been better about explaining the size of our dishes. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We had also ordered a Corba because we love Turkish lentil soup and just had to try it. It wasn't the best I've had but it was good. It also came with the home made bread which we were told they also sell on it's own. The Chicken Pide was really tasty but I felt it expensive for the size at R145. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>They have some Turkish sodas on the menu of which I had the pomegranate, as well as the usual suspects. The lemonade is homemade so it's not as sweet as you might expect. I had to swap my drink with my son Taufeeq as he wasn't enjoying the tartness of the lemonade. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Needless to say, we went home with plenty of leftovers.

The walls are adorned with car posters, old school car fenders and there's even a small sofa made from a car seat. It's a petrol-head's dream. Even the bathroom sinks look like car tyres and you have to push the pedal with your foot to make the water come out of the taps. It's very innovative to say the least.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We went to get some lunch on a very hot Sunday afternoon. The inside has comfy booth seating, a few smaller tables and a long bench table against one wall where a big family was having a meal. We were seated inside but had to ask very quickly to be moved outside as there is no aircon and it was simply too hot inside. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Our waiter offered us menus and came back shortly to take our orders. All the food had motoring related names which was a fun touch. The starters were called a \"Minor Service\", and the desserts the \"Major Service\". We opted for the Chiron Burger, the Donner Mix Box and a Toasted Masala Chicken Sandwich. The food didn't take too long though we were advised that other meals like the steaks take 30 to 40 minutes to prepare.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The Burger at R150 was layered with a patty, hash brown and pulled brisket. It looked amazing and was the star of the show. The Donner box at R160 contained donner style beef, hummus, tzatziki, chips and salad. It was served in a Chinese takeout style box that you had to pull apart and flatten to reveal the food. It was novel but messy. Personally I didn't like that the sauces and food got mixed up in the process. The tzaziki was really good though. The toasted sandwich at R90 was underwhelming. I found it too dry and and the filling was a bit on the thin side. The seasoning on the fries was good but it was not hand-cut chips which I think would have been much better. Our mocktails were gorgeous and refreshing. They both were garnished with boba but the straws were too thin for the boba and we had to sample them using a fork to get to them.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We didn't try the shakes but being an American style diner they would likely be something to talk about. We ended off with 2 small Lavazza espresso's which were quite good.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I felt like the full vibe of the place didn't quite come through. The decor is fun but the energy in the service was lacking. Perhaps later at night when it's full and the shisha crowd is there the vibe might be better. I'd go again though to try the shakes and dessert and maybe another round of that Chiron Burger!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->","post_title":"Smylies Diner, Greenside","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"smylies-diner-greenside","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2023-11-29 23:30:43","post_modified_gmt":"2023-11-29 21:30:43","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/?post_type=listing&#038;p=16085","menu_order":0,"post_type":"listing","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"1","filter":"raw"},{"ID":16077,"post_author":"11237","post_date":"2023-11-28 12:33:43","post_date_gmt":"2023-11-28 10:33:43","post_content":"<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Casual fast food outlet serving Gatsby's, Burgers, Sarmies, Pizza and more...<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->","post_title":"Ray's Relish, Newlands","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"rays-relish-newlands","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2023-11-28 12:35:17","post_modified_gmt":"2023-11-28 10:35:17","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/?post_type=listing&#038;p=16077","menu_order":0,"post_type":"listing","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},{"ID":16072,"post_author":"11227","post_date":"2023-11-28 11:29:45","post_date_gmt":"2023-11-28 09:29:45","post_content":"Akamah Estate\nEvents Venue\nConstantia, Cape Town\nFully Halaal\nWeddings, Accommodation, Conferences, Birthdays, Baby\/Bridal Showers, Birthdays, High Teas and Spa.","post_title":"Akamah Estate, Constantia","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"akamah-estate-constantia","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2023-11-28 11:29:48","post_modified_gmt":"2023-11-28 09:29:48","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/?post_type=listing&#038;p=16072","menu_order":0,"post_type":"listing","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},{"ID":16039,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2023-11-22 16:01:51","post_date_gmt":"2023-11-22 14:01:51","post_content":"<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Relaxed late night Turkish restaurant and shisha lounge.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->","post_title":"Zeetan Turkish, Sea Point","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"zeetan-turkish-sea-point","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2023-11-22 17:20:53","post_modified_gmt":"2023-11-22 15:20:53","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/?post_type=listing&#038;p=16039","menu_order":0,"post_type":"listing","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"2","filter":"raw"},{"ID":16030,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2023-11-22 00:37:07","post_date_gmt":"2023-11-21 22:37:07","post_content":"<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The words \u201cFine Dining\u201d gets thrown about in the halaal restaurant space quite casually.

Lime Tree Garden in Centurion was a lucky find on Instagram. This hidden gem has been around for 3 years and I just came across it about a month ago. It is Muslim owned and situated behind \ud835\udc01\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc20\ud835\udc26\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc27\u2019\ud835\udc2c \ud835\udc06\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc1d\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc27 \ud835\udc02\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc1e in <a href=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/2023\/09\/cafe-kremino-rewriting-the-fast-food-story\/\">Centurion<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We headed there for breakfast on a Sunday morning. You turn into the Nursery parking and can walk through the Nursery to find the restaurant at the back or you can take your car down the side of the property where there is plenty of parking at the back and a quick entrance to the restaurant. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Part of the restaurant has inside seating which is shaded and cooler in summer, but the larger seating area is outside. Wooden garden tables and benches offer casual seating amidst plants and trees fruiting mulberries and limes as the name implies. The tables are sheltered but depending on the time of day some tables will still be in full sun. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>They were quiet for a warm Sunday morning and we had our pick of the tables. Menus were swiftly brought to the table and we ordered some drinks while we decided what to order. The menu offers a variety of Middle Eastern dishes, All-day Breakfast, Toasties, Pizza, and a small kids menu. They also have a Vegan and Vegetarian menu.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>While we sipped our freshly squeezed pineapple juices we ordered the Shakshuka for me, Syrian Chef Kofta for Zulfi, the BBQ Chicken Syrian wrap for Taufeeq and the Cajun Chicken Syrian Tramezzini for my cousin who shared it with her mom. While waiting for our meals we walked around and explored the garden a bit. It's a tranquil setting. All the music you need is the tinkling of the water feature and the birds in the trees. There is a large play area for smaller kids that will keep them entertained while you just soak up the peaceful vibes. Further back there is more seating and areas that can be used for small functions and events. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The food took a while to come but they were carefully presented. The portions were large, particularly the Tramezzini was enough for 2 people. I had ordered some extra sausage with my shakshuka and it was brought on a sideplate on a bed of chopped greens. I liked that even though this was a casual venue such care was taken with presentation of the food.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We all enjoyed everything we ordered. The sausage and kofta's were good quality and tasty. Just my egg in my shakshuka was over-cooked and I was not asked how I preferred it. Note, the tramezzini is not in a yeast bread but served in a syrian wrap. I spite of the heat we enjoyed some Turkish mint tea afterwards which is served in a pot for 2. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Service from our waitress was good but it would have been nice if the owner who was about, had come to check on the tables during the time we were there as well. Prices are very reasonable and our bill for 5 people came to about R550. By Joburg standards that's a steal. They even have a 200g Beef fillet on the menu for R110. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After breakfast we took a walk through the nursery. If you're a gardener or hobbyist you'll love the little eclectic spaces and quirky garden humour peppered throughout. There's even a small shed with interesting antique looking glassware and ceramics that you can purchase. It's a relaxing morning out that I look forward to enjoying again. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->","post_title":"Lime Tree Tea Garden, Centurion","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"lime-tree-tea-garden-centurion","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2023-10-12 01:16:44","post_modified_gmt":"2023-10-11 23:16:44","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/?post_type=listing&#038;p=15786","menu_order":0,"post_type":"listing","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},{"ID":15652,"post_author":"11034","post_date":"2023-09-22 09:39:21","post_date_gmt":"2023-09-22 07:39:21","post_content":"At The Velvet Effect, we\u2019re your go-to for unforgettable special occasions!

Until more outlets start offering it, be prepared to wait your turn. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The venue is located in St Peters Square in Observatory on the second floor. They are only open for dinner and reservations are a must. The decor is simple with open industrial celings. This is needed for the concertina style copper extractors which is dramatically pulled down from above when your grill is lit. They are a must have or you'd be sitting in a haze of smoke trying to find one another. Seating is booth style and is designed for large groups. Each table with it's bbq pit set inside can take about 8 people. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The service was good and the waiters knew the menu well.

The mocktails were a citrusy Yuzu and a refreshing Basil &amp; Mint. Both were delicious. We ordered the Beef Brisket BBQ and the Bulgogi BBQ. The brisket comes in a 250g portion as paper thin roll-ups which gets cooked rolled up on the grid. The Bulgogi is slices of beef marinated in soy, sugar, garlic and seasonings. Both were cooked for us by our waiter. You don't in fact have to do your own braaing. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The BBQ set comes with bottomless sides of different sauces, hot and mild, pickled radish, potato, lettuce, kimchi, onions, rice and more. I found the marinated beef more tasty. The brisket was a bit plain but the idea is to pack your meat, rice and condiments into a lettuce leaf, roll it up and eat it like that. You can have endless flavour combinations depending on what you put together. We all enjoyed this as a fun interactive dining experience.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Some of the other dishes included Chicken Wontons - delicious, Sausage Kimbab which looks like sushi but has meat and veg - ok, Mini Corndog - bland, Korean Fried Chicken cubes - yum, Dakgalbi which is stir fried chicken and veg - good, Beef Short Ribs - delicious, and several more that I forget the names of. We tried 2 desserts, the one was a fried dough made with rice served with honey, I didn't enjoy this, it was too stodgy. The other was a flat fried pastry with a nutty filling, hint of cinnamon, drenched in honey and served with ice cream. I enjoyed this, it gave me Baklava vibes. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The average price of the BBQ options is R300 and the mains are about R160.

We decided on the Selva Omelette, Selva Breakfast and the Hangry Eggs Benedict. The Omelette comes with macon, mushrooms, tomatoes &amp; two cheeses. I wasn\u2019t expecting the punch of flavour and throroughly enjoyed this breakfast. The macon was meaty and a good quality. The Selva Breakfast was substantial and well priced at R89. It includes fried or scrambled eggs with macon &amp; breakfast sausage, tomatoes, mushrooms, spicy baked beans with a choice of bread and a side of chips. I always rate a breakfast by the quality of the sausage, and this one did not disappoint. The Hangry Eggs Benedict with two poached eggs, macon, avo, sauted spinach, mushrooms &amp; hollandaise sauce on bread, at R125 was average though the eggs were poached to perfection.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We also tried a fresh pressed juice of Apple and mint.

There is nothing ordinary about these desserts. Think Ferrero Croissant, literally enrobed in chocolate, Baklava Tea Cake, Cheesecake Truffles, Salted Caramel Pretzel Shortbread and Brownie Slabs that feed 4. They also have a few savoury options which includes stuffed parathas, homemade pies and sliders.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>While waiting I had the chance to chat to the owner Shanaaz Osman. Originally hailing from Durban, she has the perfect personality for this business. Passionate about her craft and a willingness to engage with her customers. Her friendliness and warmth made us feel like we were talking to an old friend. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Once seated we chose to share a steak paratha and cheesecake truffles. Service was a bit slow and our dessert came before the main. But our server was friendly and knew his stuff. The steak paratha was not overly stuffed. The paratha itself was buttery and crisp and the filling was tasty without being too spicy. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The cheesecake truffles comes with a choice of 3 truffles and a butterscotch sauce. I chose the Snickers, Peppermint and Lotus Biscoff. It was already drizzled with a little sauce which I thought was a bit spare. I mentioned this to the waiter and he brought some extra sauce to pour over. In order of preference we loved the Snickers then the Lotus and then the Peppermint. None of these were overly sweet which was perfect for me. And the extra sauce came in handy.  <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We rounded this off with a beautifully presented hot chocolate. I had seen it served to another table and could not resist. It's made from scratch and cooked, not just powder added to milk. Unfortunately my serving was scorched and had a burnt taste. However they promptly took it off the bill and offered me another. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The pricing is luxe. The paratha was about R95, croissant is about R65 and the average dessert is R130. But the desserts are wow! so you know what you're paying for. It's not the kind of dessert you buy because you need a quick sugar fix. You're going the mindfully enjoy this visually first and slowly savour it till the last bite.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>They are only operating with seating for 3 weeks and so teething problems are expected.

A very accurate description as the menu is part Greek, part Portuguese and all flavour. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We were invited to try out this new spot in Rivonia and were able to taste-test some of the key items on the menu. Halaal Greek food is not an easy find. There's plenty of <a href=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/2022\/07\/turkey-travels-exploring-istanbul-1\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Turkish<\/a> options sure, but Greek slaps a little different. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The main Greek option on the current menu is the Gyro pronounced: Hero. A traditional gyro is usually made from meat cooked on a vertical rotisserie and served wrapped in pita bread. At GRK, they don't use the vertical rotisserie but the meat is prepared in an impressive 7 hour process of prepping, flavouring, layering, boiling, flash-freezing, shaving and cooking before being folded into a traditional wrap with your choice of greek sauces. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The Gyro comes in a choice of 4 different pitas, your choice of meat or falafel and sauce. We went for the Village Pita (Choriatiki) - This yellow colored pita consists of wheat flour and hard-wheat flour, which has high protein content. The distinctive yellow hue is a result of turmeric powder which is added during the mixing process. The pita bread was delicious, soft and textured quite unlike other pitas I have had before. The beef was tender and tasty and the sauces spread on to the pita and not just added on top. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We had the the chicken livers starter which at a ridiculous R32 was a generous portion and could suffice as a light meal. It has a creamy base which is different from the other options out there. The mild version was tasty but I will opt for the hot next time.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We also tried the 6 small prawns which were larger than expected. I was expecting a more dry version but it came in a creamy sauce which has a unique flavour. A <a href=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/collectionlisting\/portuguese\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Portuguese<\/a> base with a slight Indian flavour. I liked the taste of home from this dish. Had this in hot and it was a good heat. Just enough so you get actual flavour and not just burn. It was served with rice which was great to sop up all that sauce. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The chicken wings were also saucy. Personally I prefer sticky wings or crispy wings. These were ok. I also prefer my wings cut into 2. The wings are served whole which can be quite messy getting stuck in  to break them apart. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So while we had tried quite a few items and did not think we would manage a dessert, we decided we could not leave without trying the signature Vaflaki. Vaflaki is a Greek dessert brand in the nature of Dip 'n Dip. Mini waffle cubes made in a special waffle maker, covered with your choice of gelato, sauces and toppings. We had the Double trouble Va\uf002aki with milk chocolate (pralina), white chocolate &amp; strawberries. It looked decadent but the waffle cubes were really light and the sweet treat was just the right thing we needed to end off our meal. We were told the waffle mix is brought in from Greece and is specific to the brand. At R89 it's a little steep but it was delicious and very shareable. You can also make up your own combinations which can increase or decrease the price. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Situated in the Rivonia Village Shopping Centre, the setting is casual and has a franchise feel. Outside seating is on a deck overlooking the parking area and the inside has a contemporary style with one section that has comfy cushioned seating and lends itself to a more upmarket vibe. I would love to see this feel translated to the full restaurant with more Greek items on the menu. A halaal Greek restaurant in the vein of a Nikos or Mythos. It's family friendly but there are plans to introduce shisha to the late night revellers as well. I can see shisha, milkshakes and dessert becoming a real thing here.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The Greek items on the menu were a bit more on the pricey side, the Beef Gyro from R90 for a single to R175 for an open plated version. But the rest of the menu was cheaper than most other eateries and offered great value with wraps and burgers starting from R33. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This is a good spot if you're a group with different tastes as the fusion menu will satisfy most.

We finally got a free Saturday with no soccer runs and playdates to play chauffeur for. It was a sunny afternoon, and after dropping Taufeeq off at his Uncle's we headed to Norwood to try out the new halaal Adega.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Adega is an upmarket Portuguese family restaurant with a focus on seafood. They also have a good selection of meat and chicken dishes too. The menu contains loads of authentic Portuguese dishes which I have come to appreciate. My father-in-law grew up in Mozambique, and I have never seen anyone enjoy good grilled prawns more than him. My mother-in-law taught me to make a traditional Portuguese dish of salted cod, potatoes and boiled egg called Bacalhau \u00e0 Br\u00e1s, which has become a regular on my table. Although we modify it with smoked snoek as I find the salted cod too intense.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The Norwood branch has a quaint and intimate vibe. You enter off-street into a pretty courtyard with high walls which blocks out the urban city setting outside. Greenery hangs from the pagoda overhead and the late afternoon sun casts a warm light into the open area where they have large umbrellas to temper the earlier midday sun. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>They were not too busy, as it was between meal times and we were having an early supper. We chose a outside table in a more shaded area but it was not under the pagoda with all the aesthetics and I'm a fussy diner. The setting has to be just so... We moved tables to one that was more pleasing to the eye and of course the camera, lol. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Our waiter was seasoned and recommended some mocktails to try from the drinks menu. I went for something new and pretty on the menu and Zulfi had a Coke. The menu is quite large with an array of starters that include in true Portuguese style Trinchado, Rissoles and Stuffed Calamari. We went straight for mains in the hope of leaving space for dessert. Zulfi ordered the Bitoque - 150g Rump steak cooked in a secret sauce, topped with an egg and served with round chips at R149. I opted for the Marisco Medley -  Prawns, kingklip, and calamari served with a side of your choice at R259. I chose the the veg side of butternut mash and creamy spinach instead of the usual chips or rice. We nibbled on the bread basket offered before the meal. Our wait was a bit long but the atmosphere was laid back and relaxed and we didn't mind.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Zulfi thoroughly enjoyed his dish, although I personally found the meat a little fatty. The sauce was mild and tangy and quite moreish. The waiter suggested we try the hot sauce on the side rather than in our dishes. A wise move as it was flaming hot. If you love extra extra heat you will enjoy this sauce. (no, that was not a typo).<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>My platter was a good choice to be able to try out a bit of everything. The kingklip was perfectly done and flaked beautifully. The prawns and calamari too did not disappoint. All of this was drifting in a delicious sauce that simply could not be wasted. So I used some of the bread to mop it all up. It was more than I could finish though, and I happily took the rest home. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Towards the evening they switched on the fairylights in the courtyard which lent a festive vibe. We couldn't leave without trying a slice of traditional Creme Caramel. I have had a truly authentic one at <a href=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/listing\/nabilas-place-kensington-jhb\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Nabila's Place<\/a> in Kensington and this came a close second. I liked the orange slice it was served with as the orange flavour complemented the dish nicely.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>They have a section which is perfect for small celebrations and have large platters which cater for families and groups. In fact, there were 2 large groups while we were there but it still felt intimate. I didn't spot a kids menu but a starter portion could work. Prices are on the higher side so it's not somewhere you'd go all the time.

Believe it or not, my family had no idea this place existed so we decided to try it out. Located in the House of Classic and Sports Cars on Main Road (vroom vroom\u2026. imagine my excitement being a bit of a speed junkie), they have a section on the one side. The space is not large and they do not have many tables but I am guessing that the seating space out of season should be okay. We waited to be seated and got a table close to the window next to a classic car.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The menu is limited but it is to be expected. Sourcing halaal meats means stock coming in from either Port Elizabeth, George or Cape Town where you are more likely to find halaal butcheries. They have a selection of toasties served on either bread or a panini, bakes such as croissants and brownies, coffees, cold drinks and milkshakes. During the festive period they also served something that is not on their daily menu. On the day we went they were serving Smash Burgers which meant my boys were HAPPY!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I opted for a Toasted Chicken and Mayo sandwich, the boys had the Smash Burgers and each enjoyed a milkshake. The food took a little longer than anticipated but in all fairness we arrived there minutes before load shedding. My sandwich was tasty. The chicken was well prepared and I enjoyed the crunch of the slaw. The boys enjoyed the Smash Burgers which was packed with flavour, spiced and cooked perfectly. We were told that the Smash Patty is made in-house by their chef. We give him a solid 9\/10 for flavour and taste. We only wish it was a little bigger.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The space is pretty, it is well lit and has that diner-meets-sophisticated feel. The owners are Muslim and are originally from Johannesburg. You can see that they take pride in their business and make you feel right at home. They take the time to come and check up on you personally even though they do have waitrons. For a petrol-head like myself, the car showroom on the premises was an added bonus. The experience on the whole was enjoyable.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I only have two negatives, one being that when they are full as in all tables are taken, they close the front gates so initially I had driven past thinking they were closed. I then called their number and was advised to come back and they did that only when they reached capacity but a family was clearing out so I would get a table. The other negative is the signage. When you are driving along the Main Road, you do not readily see it. You see a coffee sign BUT the halaal logo is small thus my family had no idea that there was this halaal gem in their hometown.

While the focus of the menu is grilled chicken, it's not the Portuguese style that has proliferated all over South Africa. The flavours are more peppery with a hint of sweet bbq and come in lemon &amp; herb, mild, hot and prego. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The branch in Benoni is the first halaal branch of the franchise. It is located next to and owned by the same family of BP Sujee Motors on Actonville circle. It's a unique concept where the building is entirely made and run out of a container. Seating is casual benches and tables outside and plenty of parking. It feels a rather like a roadhouse. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We ordered ahead to collect and take it home and decided to try a bit of everything. A big focus on the menu is the Kota. What is a kota you ask? I would say it's a sister to the Bunny Chow. A quarter (kota) loaf of bread is hollowed out, filled first with a layer of french fries, then topped with optional layers of sauce, cheese, egg, and meat.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We ordered the Soweto Kota - filled with garlic polony, russian, chicken fillet, egg and cheese, topped with atchar, half chicken and chips (you can also opt for rice, pap or salad), 6 wings and the chicken livers. Yes, our eyes were a bit big as we are only 2 and half people. The portions are really good. The livers can easily feed 2 people, though it comes with one roll only. This was my favourite. The flavour is hot but tangy and so moreish. Move over Nando's livers. Ridiculously cheap at R29!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The Kota is a tummy filler. I found it too bready and heavy. The polony had a nice flavour but in general the kota was a bit dry for me. I would request more sauce. The chicken wings comes on a skewer. And the 6 wings are in fact 6 full wings. Not cut in half as is the norm with all other franchises. While it was saucy and flavourful, I found the full uncut wing messy to eat. However I was at home and could get my hands dirty.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The chicken itself was tender and the flavour was a nice change from the predominently Portuguese style we are used to. The chips were ok but plain and could have used a seasoning salt of some sort. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Prices are very reasonable. Our entire order came to R198. So if you'd like to try out some halaal Kazi style cuisine Benoni is where you'll get it for now.

We reviewed the Umhlanga branch of Po'Boys. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We arrived at the venue which seems to be situated&nbsp; amidst a student accommodation complex. Very well-suited, since the whole concept of Po'boy is vibey, casual and tasty. We walked into a splash of bright red painted walls and glossy black floors. Theme colours which carry through to the takeaway boxes as well. The venue can accommodate a small group of friends grabbing a quick bite, although there is nothing \u201csmall\u201d or \u201cquick\u201c about a po'boy! Here definitely more is MORE !<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Having been invited by the owner, in true Durban-style hospitality, we were treated to several po'boys to get a broader taste experience.

The inside space is not very big with perhaps 3 tables, but they have an outside section overlooking Florida road that can accommodate plenty more.

My Avo and Chickpea on ciabatta toast was fresh and filling but I felt the lemon flavour from the avo was a bit too strong. Kausar felt her Cafe Mocha was too sweet for her, but she is not one for too much sweet foods to begin with. I enjoyed my Choc Macadamia latte.

We simply loved the interior. Deep button royal blue and emerald green velvet chairs are framed by walls clad in artificial leaf treatment and bright pink accents. You have a sense of the ocean with bright pops of colour. Well suited to a spot specializing in sushi and seafood.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We were invited to come and try out the new menu the same week they opened. Chef and owner Zain and his wife Aadilah are both passionate about the Seven Seas brand. This is the third branch that they have opened and the first to offer Teppanyaki.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Chef Zain explains that he wanted to offer an authentic experience and has been very careful in the way he has developed the menu. The recipes retain their Asian integrity and are flavourful without succumbing to the Durban tradition of hot spices and masala. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We tried the Thai Green Chicken Curry, a slightly thicker and more creamy broth than I am used to filled with crunchy veggies and tender chicken. This was a large portion for one person and was very tasty.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The prawn and calamari Teppanyaki was prepared on the flat grill before us.

Flavours again were on point and the seafood prepared perfectly.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The crispy chicken and prawn wontons were beautifully plated on a slate tile atop a bed of julienned slaw, but probably the dish we least enjoyed. I found the wonton wrapper too thick and the dipping sauce of soy and fresh chillies was simply too hot and overpowered the wontons.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And of course the meal would be incomplete without trying the <a href=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/2021\/02\/halaal-sushi-spots-in-cape-town\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">sushi<\/a>. Aadilah curated a selection for us which included salmon roses, prawn avalanche, salmon rainbow roll and prawn bean curd. We could find simply no fault with the sushi and it must have been some of the best sushi I have had. Just be aware, the tempura prawn topped sushi is not a whole prawn but rather a piece of prawn. On the upside, you can potentially fit the whole thing into your mouth. Unless you\u2019re me and can never eat your sushi in one bite.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The restaurant also offers Haagen Dasz ice cream and Bobar Bubble Tea. I had a passion fruit one and didn\u2019t find it overly sweet. They also prepared a mocktail using Haagen Dasz strawberry sorbet and sparkling water. This was very good and using sparkling water instead of something like sprite ensured that it too wasn\u2019t overly sweet.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Teppanyaki prices start from R150 for Kingklip to R250 for 8 King Prawns. Our dish came in at R235. It\u2019s not limited to seafood. You can also get beef, chicken or lamb. And it comes with egg fried rice, noodles or stir fry veg. The Thai curries are quite reasonable at about R90 considering the portion size. Some of the sushi is a little pricey but the platters are very well priced with a 26-piece platter going for R195.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I\u2019d come back for those prawns but there\u2019s also so much more on the menu to try.

Milder heat is also available but what\u2019s the fun in that.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>What I like a most about the place, is its complete lack of pretension. Everything is simple. It\u2019s like sitting in the kitchen of a modest home. The kind you might have grown up in. There\u2019s no paintings adorning the walls, or fancy dinnerware. But you will get the best olive oil, chilli sauce and prawns this side of Moz!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The whole family is running this business.

It\u2019s saucy prawns and chips. And you need Portuguese rolls to mop up all the sauce. Zulfi had Mozambican prawns, Taufeeq had prawns with lemon butter and I had the grilled pican\u00e2. The prawns as always were faultless. The pican\u00e2 was a very generous 3 pieces of steak. It was a little dry but I ordered it medium to well. You have to have this medium or rare. Flavour was kept simple, letting the meat shine, but I was offered some of the chicken sauce on the side. Our bill came to R790 including including drinks and dessert for 3 people. However their prawns at R160 for 6 is cheaper than most other places I've been lately.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>They also serve chicken and authentic Portuguese dishes like Bacalhau and Rissoles that you won\u2019t find everywhere.

He explained that he acquired the property during 2020 and intended to use it as an Air BnB. However, with Covid-19, he needed to create a new vision for the space.

The salmon and avo salad was fresh, crunchy and delicious. We added Balsamic vinegar and this really added more depth to the flavour. I loved the addition of sunflower seeds which added extra crunch. They used Norwegian smoked salmon and not trout which many restaurants use instead.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Our mains were served soon after. My breakfast meal was simple but tasty with the flavours working well together. The health bread was right up my alley. It was topped with avo, scrambled eggs, crisp warm salmon and dill.

Excited why? Cos my boys were invited too (happy dance). We love pizza... we love a good pizza even more.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We arrived just after the lunchtime crowd which seemed like a good idea as the shop itself is small but cosy with very limited seating space. The lack of seating space is made up for by the vastness of the menu.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The menu was pre-chosen for us and consisted of two salad starters, three pastas and three pizzas. We had the Mediterranean Salad and a Salmon Salad for starters. Both were very fresh, did not skimp on the feta cheese and the Salmon Salad had sufficient (and decent) pieces of Salmon in it. My two boys obviously went for the Salmon one cos they're bougee like that and thoroughly enjoyed it.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The pizzas and pasta were all served at the same time so you could choose what to start with. I opted to start with the pasta first and then work my way around to the pizzas. The boys had a different idea where they went for whatever appealed to the eye first.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The three kinds of pasta served were Mario, Roma and Treviso. I've listed them in order of preference. The Mario is made of pan-fried mushrooms in a Chilli pesto sauce and garnished with pepperdews. It has a little bit of a bite but not overpowering and is very tasty. I love mushrooms and there was plenty in the dish. The Roma has a Napoletana sauce base and comes with pulled chicken, small bites of Macon and a hint of chilli Mayo. My boys loved this one. The Treviso was both mine and the boy's least favourite. It's a pasta pesto topped with grilled veg. I have nothing against a veggie pasta, however personally I do not favour aubergine, baby marrows or butternut in a pasta. Though I can't fault the pesto flavoring as it was on point.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The three pizzas served was Cristini, Florentina and Bardelli. The Cristini Pizza didn't last too long as all three of us really enjoyed this pizza. In the words of my youngest, \"It was lip-smacking good\". The base of the pizza is thin which is great because then you can actually taste your toppings. It also has that crispness around the edges\u2026.the classic crust. I love that. It's not burnt, it's slightly brown and crispy. Topped with pieces of macon, sun-dried tomatoes, cream cheese and spring onions. Cristini sounds simple but the taste is far from it. There were some crispy bits of macon in between, and we liked that as well as the fact they did not skimp on the cream cheese. The only thing missing for me on this pizza was a little extra garlic and maybe some chillies. Everything else was perfect.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The Florentina is topped with creamy spinach, mushroom and feta. It's a wonderful veggie option and was quite divine. Spinach has always been a firm favourite for me so this was good. The Bardelli was my least favourite in part because I'm not a fan of smoked chicken. However, my boys liked it. The Bardelli is made from macon, smoked chicken, mushrooms, peppers and pecorino cheese which is Italian, salty cheese.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>All in all, it was a delicioso experience. My boys and I ate ourselves to the brim and yet there were leftovers. Keep in mind that the one is an adult and the other a teenager so they have healthy appetites. Portion sizes are more than adequate. The price range is between R80 and R169 for pizzas depending on the toppings and the size of course and the pasta options are more or less the same. The menu comprises of meat, chicken, seafood and vegetarian options. You have the option to swap out for a full vegan-friendly or banting pizza base at an additional charge. They even have a no calorie pasta as well as gluten-free pasta for those who are banting or carb-conscious.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The menu also includes calzones which are folded pizzas, grill options like lamb shank and a small selection of desserts, coffees and milkshakes.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Although the seating is quite limited inside, I'd imagine during the warmer months it would be great to chill outside as they have a few sidewalk tables. The manager did tell me that they are looking at reconfiguring the front of store to add a few more tables. However, if all else fails, take your food to go. They are available on Uber Eats, Mr D, Bolt and have an in-house driver to cover the areas that the delivery companies do not.

So when Saaleha, the owner of the iconic Upcycled Cafe in Benoni first mentioned she was planning to open an Asian Fusion restaurant I was brimming with anticipation. Months later her vision has come to life, with Origami opening at the new Lakefield Junction complex. Another addition to the East, making it one of almost 10 great halaal sit-down spots. This gives locals even more options and makes Benoni more of a destination choice for halaal foodies.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The decor is original and so intriguing. Taking its inspiration from the Japanese art of Origami, with touches of the paper art on the walls. The space is literally outfitted like a sketch. With white walls, furniture and surfaces outlined with bold black lines. My first thought was that it had an Alice-in-wonderland feeling, like a storybook. But the monochromatic style that forms the backdrop of this space really is a blank canvas on which the food becomes the art. Like she did with Upcycled Cafe, Saaleha turned this space too into a creative expression of food and art.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The menu like the space, is minimilistic. Choose from a handful of starters, we chose the Korean Fried Wings, 4 choices of Bao Buns, we chose the fifth one, the \"Can't Decide Bao\", which is a combo of 3, and 3 choices of noodle dishes, I had the OG flavour, a Tom Yum flavour base with your choice of protein, I had the Prawns. There's also Bahm Mi, which is like a filled baguette, asian style, and a full sushi menu. We couldn't try the sushi as they were not quite ready with it for the day, but I have sampled the prep menu at Upcycled and can vouch that it is inventive and non-traditional. Though they have some standard varieties for us purists. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The Korean wings were crispy and saucy with a tang that hit the mark. It's a generous portion for a starter or could even make a light meal. The 3 different Bao fillings comprised of cooked Salmon on one, Chicken on the other and Haloumi on the third. Hubby wasn't mad about the Salmon version, but the sauce on the Haloumi one had him singing. The buns while light and fluffy were large and the 3 made for a filling meal, in fact, the chicken one went home for later. The Noodles were flavoured with fresh lemongrass and sesame. The Tom Yum flavour was spot on, I was just sorry I ordered it mild as it had great flavour but no chilli. I was playing it safe as some places' mild version is already hot. Next time I will definitely have the hot version. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The mocktails are reminiscent of what they have at Upcycled, though the range is smaller and more carefully selected to suit the menu. My Ginger and Basil mocktail was refreshing and light. We didn't try the dessert but that's a reason to go back real soon. There's a sweet Thai Roti dish which throws me back to a long-ago trip to Thailand.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Prices are not bad. Most of the meals are at around R75 to R95. Only the Noodle dishes I thought to be a bit pricey at R159 for Haloumi to R189 for the Prawn version.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We went for a midday breakaway when the space was bright and airy. I'm curious to see what the ambiance is like at night. A bit romantic with a healthy dose of quirky I imagine...<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->","post_title":"Origami, Benoni","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"origami-benoni","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2022-02-10 02:44:52","post_modified_gmt":"2022-02-10 00:44:52","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/?post_type=listing&#038;p=12790","menu_order":0,"post_type":"listing","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"1","filter":"raw"},{"ID":12791,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2022-02-09 23:54:31","post_date_gmt":"2022-02-09 21:54:31","post_content":"<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>An iconic and vibey halaal&nbsp;burger joint, well known for Smashburgers and Freakshakes.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Read&nbsp;our house&nbsp;review of the Melrose Arch branch <a href=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/city\/johannesburg\/listing\/rocomamas-melrose-arch\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->","post_title":"Rocomamas, Rynfield","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"rocomamas-rynfield","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2024-04-17 20:41:31","post_modified_gmt":"2024-04-17 18:41:31","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/?post_type=listing&#038;p=12791","menu_order":0,"post_type":"listing","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},{"ID":12767,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2022-02-09 22:02:48","post_date_gmt":"2022-02-09 20:02:48","post_content":"<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There\u2019s a new Wood fire pizza place on the block.

They are now located upstairs at 102 Wale Street, next to the Atlas entrance. Once again situated against the backdrop of the beautiful Bo-Kaap community.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Parking is easier than at the previous location, I managed to find one close to the entrance quite easily. From the time I walked in, I loved the atmosphere which had loads of natural light and was a lot more spacious than the previous location.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I was then welcomed and seated by a friendly staff member who was eager to assist. The d\u00e9cor has remained true to the previous Against The Grain space, with bottle green and light green accents, beech wood tables and black iron chairs. They have a little seating area with a black couch and a coffee table if you feel like having an even more relaxed experience. There are planters right around the seating area, which livens up the space quite a bit. The overall d\u00e9cor and space has a more contemporary feel which I loved. &nbsp;There is ample seating, all very spaced out which I thought was great. Large windows around the one side which allows for beautiful views and the natural lighting is definitely a plus point. They have a large counter with the selection of dessert and pastry items visible.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After being seated, a waitron brought me a menu and I ordered the ice chocolate as my drink of choice. Soon after that my drink arrived along with two koeksisters. One bite was enough to know that the koeksisters were already my favourite and I hadn\u2019t even gotten to the food part yet! &nbsp;The koeksisters were served warm and tasted heavenly, the perfect combination of sweet and spicy whilst being wonderfully moist. Not really being a koeksister person, I was surprised that I very easily finished both koeksisters.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The menu is concise and offers bagels with a twist, house salad, breakfast bowls, light meals and soup of the day. There is also a wonderful selection of pastries as well as koeksisters. The drinks menu consists of a range of coffees, iced coffees, tea and cooldrinks. In my opinion the food and drinks were both very reasonably priced and would only cost you around R130 per person. This includes your food, a drink as well as a pastry or koeksister.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Before we were served our meals, Gesant Abed, the co-owner came by my table for a quick chat. He gave me some background into how Against The Grain was born. From our conversation, it was clear they had to adapt very quickly after opening just before the pandemic hit. They changed up the menu to offerings that were easy for on-the-go and picnics etc. They have plans to expand the menu and also use the new rooftop area for events.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I was then served a variety of six mini bagels, various combinations off the main menu but in miniatures. The bagel combinations were gesmoorde eggs, soutvleis, easy philly, crispy chicken, lost and salmon with cream cheese. My favourites were definitely the crispy chicken and the salmon with cream cheese bagel. The crispy chicken had jalapenos which gave it the perfect amount of kick. The chicken was tasty and made for a great bagel topping. If you like steak, you will enjoy the easy philly, which is a combination of steak with cheese. If you prefer something sweet on your bagel, the lost would be right up your alley as it had Nutella and strawberries.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The service was great, staff were attentive and were knowledgeable when it came to the menu.

The need to unplug is becoming more and more of a reality. And the body and mind needs to get in touch with the earth to ground themselves again. It's inherent even in our sujud. Every time you touch your head to the ground the earth absorbs the energy which does not serve you. So visiting The Cradle Berry Farm allowed us some meaningful unplugging of note. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It's close to the Cradle of Humankind, an hours drive for us from Benoni, about 30 minutes if you're coming from Johannesburg. The road gets really pretty about 10 minutes before you reach there. It was quite lush and we saw some of the same vegetation as in the Drakensburg. Being close to the cradle there were a few lodges and resorts and I made a mental note that this would be a nice getaway sometime soon to come and visit the historic cradle region. As a world heritage site it is so named as it is the site of the largest number of hominid fossils to ever be discovered and dates back to almost 3.5 million years ago.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The road to the farm turns off directly from the highway. It's a dirt road which is a bit rough and unsuitable if your car is low. My polo just managed it ok. The farm is adjacent to a guesthouse which is not part of the property. A rustic cabin is a meeting point where we were greeted by a Turkish couple who own the farm. There are rows of strawberries planted in the ground as well as a bank of tiered planters. We are told by another visitor to go right to the end of the field as there were still good strawberries there. The closer plants had been picked clean by now. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There was plenty of space and we were glad Taufeeq and his friend had brought a ball. Like most 8 year olds strawberry picking can only hold their attention for so long. They spent more time running around the open field and feeding the goats.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It was a hot day and we took time between picking to just stand under the shade of the tall trees on the side of the property and enjoy the light wind that whistled through the silence. At this point we were the only family there and the silence and space was so tranquil.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There is no store or deli to buy food but you can bring your own food and enjoy as many of the strawberries as you want while picking. I was so in tune with my surroundings that day I was even eating unwashed and spotty strawberries straight off the vine. Even the dusty ones didn't bother me. Just brushed off the dirt and popped them in my mouth. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There is an area under the trees with rustic wooden picnic tables. We sat and enjoyed some cheese and crackers we had brought with us and just absorbed the sight of the mountains. A raised wooden staging area with flower decorated arches was just behind us where you can have casual events or a rustic wedding. Toilets were ok and had bottles for water but no paper. I suggest you make sure you have a roll in the car before you head out there. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>They charge R70 a kilo for the strawberries you pick or R25 for a smaller punnet. We paid by eft as they don't have a credit card facility. The strawbs I brought home did not last too long and got soft a bit too quickly, though they were sweeter than most store bought I have had recently. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The farm is still young with little infrastructure. When I asked about food, the Turkish owner told me they want to open a coffee shop here in another year or so. He also said with a day or two's notice they can prepare a traditional meal for us. A great incentive for me to want to go again.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->","post_title":"The Cradle Berry Farm, Muldersdrift","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"goldenberry-strawberry-farm-muldersdrift","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2023-10-04 14:50:56","post_modified_gmt":"2023-10-04 12:50:56","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/?post_type=listing&#038;p=12422","menu_order":0,"post_type":"listing","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},{"ID":12357,"post_author":"6862","post_date":"2021-11-25 20:33:49","post_date_gmt":"2021-11-25 18:33:49","post_content":"<p>We are halaal certified restaurant\/catering company, we cater for any size of event or function<\/p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->","post_title":"Aroma.com, Mondeor","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"aroma-com-mondeor","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2021-11-25 20:33:54","post_modified_gmt":"2021-11-25 18:33:54","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/?post_type=listing&#038;p=12357","menu_order":0,"post_type":"listing","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},{"ID":12374,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2021-11-25 10:29:59","post_date_gmt":"2021-11-25 08:29:59","post_content":"<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Galata is a Turkish restaurant well known for their desserts and Tre Leche (Milk Cakes).

Tables with Moroccan inlays are flanked by versailles style dining chairs in different colours. Large windows look out over the garden and outside seating area and allow an abundance of light in.

They have a choice of Indian, Moroccan, Chinese and Western dishes. Prices are quite reasonable with the average meal price less than R100. Fillet steak at R150 and prawns at R135. We opted for the Beef Chapli Kebab for him, the Chicken Chilli for me and the Kids Burger and chips for Taufeeq. The Chapli Kebab is a Peshawari-style flat kebab served with chips. This was tasty and enjoyable with the light fresh salad alongside. My Chicken Chilli comprised of battered chicken strips with mixed peppers and chilli paste, served with fried rice. This was slightly sweet and quite hot though I thoroughly enjoyed it despite fending off tears and a runny nose. The fried rice also was really good. I would order this again though may ask for it a bit less hot. The Moroccotini - watermelon and cranberry syrup with fresh ginger served with ginger ale was a little spicy and quite yummy. A must try if you like ginger.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Taufeeq's burger was really big for a kids burger. While generous it could end up being wasteful. I suggest cut it in half so half can still be taken away or eaten by dad as is often the case with parents of small children. He would have liked a milkshake of which they have quite an assortment of flavours including Coconut-Almond, Bubblegum,Turkish Delight and Fireball but the kids meal came with a juicebox.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We chose to have dessert and coffee outside at one of the tables in the garden.

What's great is that many of them are not just your average kebab and shawarma spot. The latest openings are presenting sophisticated dining with upmarket settings. Lokkum Restaurant is the latest addition. Situated in the Fourways Mall in <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/2020\/12\/the-hungry-for-halaal-top-restaurant-picks-of-2020\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"Johannesburg (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">Johannesburg<\/a><\/strong>, and having barely opened 3 weeks ago, they have already made a splash on the halaal food scene. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We went for lunch on a month-end Saturday. Perhaps it was because Covid is still keeping people at home, but the mall was not too busy. After some confusion navigating the parking, we parked at the lower level parking which happened to be right at the entrance where the restaurant is located. This is also the entrance that leads to the food court and movies. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The restaurant is dim and cosy with a beautiful backlit feature wall on one side. Scalloped drapes make an interesting ceiling feature on the inside section of the restaurant. Glass doors lead to an outside area with a jungle gym. Only slightly more casual this section is great for families with kids and parents who want to be seated nearby to keep an eye on them.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It was surprisingly quiet for lunchtime with only 2 other tables occupied. They were fuller late afternoon when we passed by after exploring the mall. Service was swift and a table appetiser of some very instagrammable bread and dips was offered. The dips comprised a herbed butter which I initially mistook for tzatziki because it was very white. A tangy and fresh tomato sauce and a delicious crumbly cheese unlike any I had tasted before. The manager later explained it was a Turkish traditional cheese that they also sell from the deli section of the restaurant. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We were also offered a selection of meze, presented on a large tray which the waiter brought around, which comes at R40 a plate. The appetiser was already substantial and anything additional would be a <a href=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/category\/recipes\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"recipe (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\"><strong>recipe<\/strong><\/a> for taking half of our meal home, so we chose to forego the meze in favour of our mains. I loved the presentation though. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We chose the Ali Nazik, a chicken Pide and the Lokkum Kofte. There is no children's menu but the pide's are suitable for the little ones. Everything was presented with flair. The stylish green crockery with gold trim was a well-chosen canvas for the food and the marble tabletops a gorgeous backdrop. The Ali Nazik, cubes of lamb served on a bed of pureed aubergine and yoghurt was substantial. The lamb was tasty and tender. The dish is not served with any kind of bread, and could have used some to scoop up some of the gravy. The kebab was also a well-sized portion, served with a thin flatbread, salad and a delicious bulghar rice. The pride was quite big and would suffice well even for an adult.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>They have the usual suspects on the drinks menu including some Turkish drinks like the popular Gazoz soda (similar to Sprite), and a Hibiscus and Pomegranate Sherbet which they sadly did not have that day and promptly deflated my excitement at wanting to try it. They also have non-alcoholic wine as an option but you'd have to purchase the bottle at between R120 to R200. Mains are from R110 (Kebab) to R220 (Fillet Steak). Pides average R100.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We were surprised with a complimentary dessert platter that included their homemade Creme Caramel and a Turkish <strong><a aria-label=\"Semolina (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/2021\/06\/nan-khatai-semolina\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">Semolina<\/a><\/strong> dessert, which is a bit like a very syrupy gulab jamun. Not really my cup of tea, but the creme caramel was superb. They also have traditional desserts like Baklava and Sutlac (rice pudding).<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>They are open every day for lunch and dinner. It's a great spot to take the family but would also be a nice venue for an intimate dinner for two.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong><em>Reviewed: November 2021<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->","post_title":"Lokkum, Norwood","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"lokkum-norwood","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2024-07-05 08:35:03","post_modified_gmt":"2024-07-05 06:35:03","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/?post_type=listing&#038;p=12310","menu_order":0,"post_type":"listing","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"1","filter":"raw"},{"ID":12303,"post_author":"6724","post_date":"2021-11-15 10:58:15","post_date_gmt":"2021-11-15 08:58:15","post_content":"Fayview is an exclusive natural wedding and function venue on the waters edge in Benoni, sharing with Flamingos and other bird life.\n\nOur flexible service includes walk in walk out or provide services to meet your budget.","post_title":"Fayview Function Venue, Benoni","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"fayview-function-venue-benoni","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2021-11-15 10:58:17","post_modified_gmt":"2021-11-15 08:58:17","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/?post_type=listing&#038;p=12303","menu_order":0,"post_type":"listing","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},{"ID":12253,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2021-11-03 22:24:32","post_date_gmt":"2021-11-03 20:24:32","post_content":"<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Iris Garden is just off Rivonia Road, not far from the freeway.

Since it was a hot Friday evening all of the outside seating was taken. We chose a table that was somewhat in the corner but also gave you a good view of the whole space. It must be noted that it got a lot fuller from around 9pm side.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Sultan Sheesha is not a large venue in comparison to its sister restaurants Saray and Eatstanbul.

The waiters were friendly and were able to explain and assist us in choosing from the menu. We opted for the Tavuk Sis and the Beef Kofta. The chicken pieces were grilled to perfection and the kebabs were flavourful but the portion sizes of both meals was too big for a single serving. We both agreed that next time we would much rather take one dish to share. I have to admit that their meals are value for money. Their mocktails are also very refreshing. We tried the Mojito, Strawberry Daiquiri and a Sundowner. The cost of each meal was roughly between R140 and R175. Mocktails average between R45 and R55 each depending.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When at a Sheesha lounge you have to smoke. So we opted for a pipe to share. The \"Sheesha guy\" comes around to take your order an prepares your pipe for you. He recommended we take a berry and mint flavoured pipe and needless to say it was good. The lingering notes of mint afterwards was refreshing. There were sliced of strawberry and some mint leaves floating in the glass vase. What was great is that we could choose between a single hose or dual hose pipe. Each hose is disposable. If you opt for a single hose pipe and you are more than one person then each person gets his\/her own disposable mouth piece. The pipe to share with two disposable hoses was R200.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Be warned that this place gets loud.

But the neighbour's got their braai going and the smell is driving you crazy... I've had those days too, so when Sizzlers Flame Grills opened up nearby in Benoni I had to go and check them out. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Sizzlers is a well known and popular home-based pop-up that have transitioned to a permanent restaurant. They are located at Atlas Junction, a little hub of halaal eateries with secure parking. We popped in around midday, and they were fairly quiet, with maybe 2 other tables occupied, and a few people coming to collect their orders. This is not always the case. On a previous occasion when I called on a Friday night they were fully booked. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It's a bright and casual setup but not in a Mcdonald's kind of way. The decor is contemporary and easy, not cheap. The big windows let in a lot of light which is great for taking those <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/hungryforhalaal\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"Instagrammable (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\">Instagrammable<\/a><\/strong> shots. We took a table close to the window. The tables are mostly large to allow for families or groups which is what you would typically do for a braai, with a few smaller ones here and there.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The menu was unexpected. I was expecting a <a aria-label=\"steakhouse (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/listing\/indianapolis-spur-boksburg\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"ek-link\"><strong>steakhouse<\/strong><\/a> type of menu. But their menu was true to theme, with proper braai sides like potato salad, pasta salad, pap &amp; chutney, green salad or garlic bread. We ordered the Steak Roll for him, T-bone steak for me and a Sausage roll and chips for Taufeeq. While we waited they brought a deliciously buttery garlic bread starter to whet our appetites. A nice surprise as casual restaurants don't normally offer a complimentary appetiser. It was delicious but I just had a taste of it so it would not spoil my appetite. We had also ordered their Braaloumi (haloumi) starter which I was keener to try. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The Braailoumi was nicely done, smokey and charred with chilli flakes and served with a sweet chilli sauce. It's good for sharing but too filling to order for one person who is also having a main meal. Unless you're really, really hungry. The Sausage roll was made with sweet chilli sausage, not a vienna which you'd normally get on a kids meal. It was really cute and served as 2 mini rolls in cocktail buns. There was attention to presentation for kids which is not often the case. I really liked this touch. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The steak roll was substantial with sirloin steak done in their Sizzlers marinade, greens, crispy fried onion rings and finished with their secret sauce. I could hardly get a word out of Zulfi during his meal, and this spoke volumes. I'm not even sure that I even tasted it as I normally would. He didn't even offer to share... The fries that came with the 2 meals were chunky thick cut and perfectly crisp. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>My T-Bone meal was a whopper. With 2 T-Bones at 450g. I did not notice how big the meal was when I ordered it. But no matter, leftovers are always great. It's also done in their signature marinade with a drizzle of their lemon butter sauce and comes with a garlic pita and a choice of side. I thoroughly enjoyed this. The steak was perfectly cooked and the taste hot and tangy. It could have been less lemony so if you're not a fan ask them to omit it. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I had ordered a Falooda milkshake to drink which I wasn't too mad about. It was a bottled pre-mix which tasted ok, but was thin for a milkshake and too frozen to drink properly. They have the usual suspects for drinks as well as a range of Fehms mocktails. Taufeeq had the Cherry Fizz which I also enjoy. All the drinks are bottled. I guess this helps with faster service. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The only out of character part of the menu are the desserts. Though to be fair I'm not sure what constitutes suitable braai desserts... toasted marshmallows or smores maybe? Desserts included Ras Malai, Kunafa, Malva Pudding and Cheesecake among others. We decided to give the Kunafa a try. It was tasty but not made with the proper cheese for this dessert, so it did not have that signature cheese pull of kunafa. And presentation in the foil baking shell did not live up to the presentation of the other dishes. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Our meal came to R500. For all we had this was not a bad spend. And I took 1 whole T-Bone home. We got the full braai experience without the fuss of having to do it ourselves. I would definitely go again. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you prefer doing your own braai, you can also buy pre-marinaded meat from them and braai at home. Just remember you'll have to wash your own dishes...<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:embed {\"url\":\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/BBDpg7UKaxA\",\"type\":\"video\",\"providerNameSlug\":\"youtube\",\"responsive\":true,\"className\":\"wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\nhttps:\/\/youtu.be\/BBDpg7UKaxA\n<\/div><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:embed -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Reviewed: October 2021<\/em><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->","post_title":"Sizzlers Flame Grills, Johannesburg","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"sizzlers-flame-grills-boksburg","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2024-01-17 16:49:06","post_modified_gmt":"2024-01-17 14:49:06","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/?post_type=listing&#038;p=11969","menu_order":0,"post_type":"listing","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},{"ID":11959,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2021-09-08 21:00:39","post_date_gmt":"2021-09-08 19:00:39","post_content":"<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Istanbul Kebab offers authentic Turkish food in a modern venue at the trending location of Melrose Square.

So on a recent trip out that way, we decided to get a quick sample of the food scene before heading home. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Due to the Group Areas Act of the Apartheid regime Indians of the then Transvaal, were designated to live in Lenasia. What started out as a humble suburb, is now a sprawling town with extensions and subsections. While the surrounding area does not make it a covetable place to live house prices have soared as established Indian families have invested their wealth in their homes. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The type of eateries in the area are the names many people have grown up with, the likes of Akhalwayas and Delhi Delicious. A few franchised sit-down restaurants such as Ocean Basket, Spur and Panarottis and your local fast food spots like KfC and Mcd's. Then there are a few hidden gems that you will only discover if you know someone from there or go digging around on the internet.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Krafted Krust is a spot that was recommended to me via the Halaal Food Establishments Gauteng Facebook group. It's part of a small complex with Creme Cafe which an indulgent ice cream and dessert shop, Golden Foods Express, which stocks frozen savouries as well as a range of gourmet and artisinal sweets and confectionary. Do not wander in here while you are waiting for your pizza order. Unless you want to come out with a much lighter wallet. You have been duly warned.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Back to Krafted Krust, this is a small pizzeria serving Neapolitan style pizzas with a twist, all their pizzas are rectangular. The menu is not huge. They have a list of Rustic flavours which are fairly common and then they have the list of artisan which includes the likes of Peri Garlic &amp; Prawn Artisan Pizza - Thin Krust, layered with mozzarella &amp; topped in flash-fried peri garlic butter prawns and finished off with fresh lemons or the CHIPPANAISE - Choice of steak strips or chicken, topped with oven-baked french fries, peri whip, peppers and layered with crispy thin pepperoni. They also have a small range of interesting burgers including a Wagyu option, but the real focus is the clay oven pizzas. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We ordered a Nachos Chicken pizza with a Mexican Salsa base topped with Tortilla chips, spring onion and green peppers. I loved the eat-in presentation where they spike the tortillas into the pizza and serve it with dozens on chips standing upright. Our's being a takeaway just got spread over the top and drizzled with sauce. We also took a classic Margharita for the munchkin. The Margharita is also the true measure of a great pizza, and this would be the litmus test. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It was 45 minutes to Benoni so we would have to wait and endure the heady pizza smells all the way home. At home we reheated the pizzas briefly in the oven. I'm glad to say the tortillas were crispy again even if they had softened a bit on the way home, and reheating did not seem to take anything away from the pizza. The flavour of the Nachos pizza was good. Suitably spicy and tangy with a delicious crunch from the chips. The Margharita was not bad having a good thin Neapolitan style base. But I thought the cheese was a bit generic and too much, and the tomato base did not come through as well as it could have. It also missed the puffier crusty edge. Prices are on par with Col'cacchios and our pizzas were in the range of R140 and R70 each.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are a few tables inside which could seat a small handful of people and they have a small outside section with a few more tables.

The Indian food culture is as much a part of Mzansi as Boerewors, Mgwinya and Koesisters. At Baluchi located in the heart of Illovo, you can expect your Indian favourites with some exciting new additions, but elevated.\n\nBaluchi restaurant first opened its doors in Alberton where they served an authentic Pakistani menu for about 2 years. Now located at the more central Illovo Junction they are taking things up a notch and aim to bring a more refined Indian food experience to Joburg foodies.\n\nWe were invited to taste-test their new menu, mocktails range and the exciting first-of-its-kind <strong>Chaat Trolley<\/strong>. But more about that in a bit.\n\nThe restaurant is cosy and can seat perhaps 60 people. The rich green and gold of the plush dining chairs lend a luxurious but contemporary feel to the space. The signature green is pulled through into the decor and even the crockery without feeling overwhelming. Modern light fittings hang from the ceiling and behind a tiled bar where you can watch your mocktails being prepared.\n\nAseema Kazi is the owner. A dynamic personality and entrepreneur at heart, her sense of style is reflected in the decor and the food at Baluchi. We ordered the Signature Baluchi and a Basil and Raspberry mocktail along with the Crispy Brinjal Fries appetiser. These came served embedded in a tasty green chutney in six shot glasses and could easily serve 3 people. The Signature mocktail was deliciously refreshing with citrus notes. I felt the Raspberry mocktail needed the Basil flavour to be stronger. While we enjoyed these, Aseema tells us about the brand new concept she is introducing, namely the Chaat Trolley.\n\nNow most of us are quite familiar with chaat and you can get it at most halaal markets and some Indian restaurants. At Baluchi they have crafted a whole chaat experience. Now you are able to order a chaat platter, and they bring the various elements to your table on a trolley. They then assemble pani-puri, dhai puri, aloo chaat and more with great theatre as you watch. I must say this was fun to watch and the pani puri is some of the best I have had. I often find pani puri water to not be flavoured enough, and I was delighted at how tasty this was. This platter is enough for 4 to 6 people as a starter or even 1 person as a meal.\n\nFor mains we tried the Lobster Biryani and their Portuguese Chicken. Yes, they do have menu items other than Indian food as well. So if you\u2019re a group with varied preferences your can still cater for everyone.\n\nThe Lobster Biryani was served with a cucumber raita and mini popadums. I love the care taken with the presentation. The masala was woven well through the rice and over the lobster tails of which there were four in this serving. Enough for 2 people. We had chosen to have this in hot. The heat was just right for my partner but I found it a little spicy. The flavour was on point and we absolutely loved this dish. The only thing I missed were potatoes which is typical of Biryani but not necessarily essential.\n\nThe Portuguese Chicken was served whole and butterflied with a basket of crisp fries. We asked for it to be cut into 8 pieces which they swiftly did. You can have it cut into quarters or halves if you prefer. I found the flavour authentic and quite lemony albeit a little mild. I had chosen the medium heat for this one. The chicken is served in the drier style, but they may offer a saucy version in the futur\n\nFor dessert we opted for the Paan flavoured ice cream. It comes in 3 scoops, lightly drizzled with rose syrup and topped with soomph (candy coated fennel seeds). Fennel is a spice well known for aiding in digestion. It was the perfect ending to our traditional yet elevated Indian meal.","post_title":"Baluchi Restaurant, Illovo","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"baluchi-authentic-indian-restaurant-illovo","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2023-10-26 03:22:11","post_modified_gmt":"2023-10-26 01:22:11","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/?post_type=listing&#038;p=11157","menu_order":0,"post_type":"listing","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},{"ID":11131,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2021-04-07 15:03:11","post_date_gmt":"2021-04-07 13:03:11","post_content":"<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Fresh and flavourful Asian inspired dishes cooked in store in the heart of Kloof Street, Gardens. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->","post_title":"The Wok Bar, Gardens","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"the-wok-bar-gardens","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2022-01-26 22:49:56","post_modified_gmt":"2022-01-26 20:49:56","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/?post_type=listing&#038;p=11131","menu_order":0,"post_type":"listing","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},{"ID":11103,"post_author":"5511","post_date":"2021-04-05 13:17:20","post_date_gmt":"2021-04-05 13:17:20","post_content":"Just Moreish is a Dessertery specialising in Ice-Cream Cheesecakes, Baked Cheesecakes and Ice Cream Cakes.

We were then introduced to head chef, Muhammad Modrek who hails from Syria. Modrek is a trained chef having studied and worked in restaurants and hotels abroad. The name of the restaurant is Muhammad's way of paying homage to one of the oldest cities in the world.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The evening commenced with a beautiful thikr followed by Magrib Salah. Before starters arrived, Mr Sonday and Muhammad addressed the attendees. He tells the tale of how he and Muhammad formed a wonderful alliance. He sees himself as the financier with Modrek and his wife being the brains behind it all. Muhammad talks about his life in Syria and how it contrasts to his life in Cape Town. He talks about his struggles and how one leap of faith taken by Mr and Mrs Sonday meant that he is now able to see his vision unfold and become real right before him.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After speeches, starters were served. We started with Harira Soup. This soup can best be described as warm, not spicy, traditional and delicious. It is made of tomato, lentils, chickpeas, meat pieces and fresh herbs. The second starter was a Mezze Platter. This platter was beautifully presented and consisted of sesiky moussaka, hummus, moutabal, baba-gounoush and yalanji and was served with cut up pita breads, salads and olives. This platter is refreshing to say the least. It is the perfect starter to share, especially when you out in a group.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Not long after the starters, the main dish arrived. The dish was a Syrian Mixed Platter for one. It was made up of a lamb chop that was juicy, tender and cooked perfectly inside. There was a half portion of Shaqaf which are tender cubes of beef fillet and a half portion of Sheesh Tawook which are chicken cubes cooked in a yogurt and tomato gravy. There was also a full Skewer Kebab. The Skewer Kebab is made of ground lamb. I generally tend to stay away from the Kebabs as at most places I have eaten them, they are usually dry. But this was moist and spiced beautifully. The meats were accompanied by a rice dish that I am told was cooked in broth over charcoals. It was definitely something different and when eating it, you could taste the full flavours coming through.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Finally, dessert was served. I must admit that after the meal I had just enjoyed, I really did not think I would have any place for dessert. I was more than happy to see that dessert was a traditional warm and crispy waffle, drizzled with chocolate sauce and served with ice cream. When I say it was a waffle of perfection, then make no mistake, IT WAS!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Mr Sonday prides himself on the fact that all fixtures and fittings were supplied and fitted by community members. He did not have to look too far out of his circle as the \u201ctalent exists among us\u201d as he put it. By the look of the finish, one can see that no expense was spared. The furniture is high end. The colour scheme as well as layout of the restaurant is beautiful and elegant. There is this vibey Arabic feel to it. It is a family restaurant but you could go there with your partner too.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The restaurant is able to host small and intimate functions in an area that can be closed off from the main restaurant.

The outside tables which look out on the bustling road were not fully occupied but we chose to sit inside. The decor inside is fresh and trendy.

White walls and high ceilings with low modern lights frame a bright space with lightwood tables and white Eames style chairs. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Our waitress was efficient at explaining the various Turkish breakfast items to us.

This comes with a pot of Turkish tea enough for at least four of the traditional Turkish cups. They brought the tea and we enjoyed that while waiting for the meal. The tea is not the apple mint variety I had experienced at other Turkish places. This was a rather plain tea with no distinct flavour. I enjoyed the spicy eggs topped with mozzarella but felt it was a bit dry. The Turkish bread was crispy and delicious and slathered with butter it was a treat. Part of me was wishing for a nice cup of chai to dip it into...<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The full house breakfast was pretty standard. It came with 2 eggs, mushrooms, lamb chop, baked beans, sausage and toast. While it sounds alot, Zulfi said he was still hungry afterwards. We had cappuccinos and shared a chocolate croissant after. The cappuccinos were good but the croissant rather disappointing. The chocolate filling was almost non existent. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>They are known for good desserts and we saw several tables indulge in dessert after their meals. We just did not have the space. The deli counter had cheesecake, several other cakes, traditional Turkish desserts and even Tres Leches. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I would come again but to try the lunch or dinner menu. The breakfast menu was average but I saw some other dishes come out to the tables that looked more impressive. A large Turkish grill platter for instance to serve a family. And I have heard from friends that their non breakfast dishes are pretty good.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I also felt that the restaurant got too full as the morning got later. While Covid protocols were observed at the entrance there was not much social distancing between tables. At one point the table next to us was seated and I realised how close together we were.

Since hearing of their Long Street branch opening recently, I decided to pop in and see what the hype is all about.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As Long Street is a prime location, off street parking may be a problem during peak hours. However, we were early enough and very easily managed to find parking right across from the restaurant.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The restaurant setup itself is quite casual, although extremely well maintained, immaculate and spacious. The d\u00e9cor comprised of beech and dark wood to create contrast as well as a focus wall. The seating was great; with booths and large tables to accommodate bigger families or groups.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Upon entering, compliance with Covid-19 regulations was evident and adhered to throughout.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The menu consists of a variety of starter meals or lighter meals, chicken meals, wraps, burgers, salads, mocktails, frappes, iced coffees and milkshakes. The menu also includes kiddies options as well as a vegetarian option. They have yet to add any desserts to the menu.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As with most casual dining spots, you decide what you would like to order from the menu screens at the counter. The staff were friendly, helpful and approachable when we asked for suggestions on what to order. We decided on the quarter chicken meal with chips, switched out the roll for a garlic roll and added a side of coleslaw. &nbsp;For the second meal, we chose the chicken wrap with a side of wedges. We were advised that the Bar-One milkshake was a winner and decided to try that along with a strawberry mocktail. We proceeded to pay, take a number and head to a table.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The service was so swift and efficient that the food arrived at our table very shortly after we sat down.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The chicken being their speciality, was definitely the highlight of the meal. The mild with extra basting had the perfect balance of spiciness and sauciness. The chicken was tender, tasty and the meal was filling. The chips had a lovely texture: crispy on the outside and light and fluffy on the inside. The garlic roll was soft, however we didn\u2019t enjoy the actual garlic butter. The coleslaw was a nice addition in that it added a tangy flavour and crunch to the meal.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I thought having the option of ordering either a basting (sauce) or a sprinkle (spice) was interesting. In having this array of options, everyone\u2019s tastes would be satisfied. The basting and sprinkle come in five different flavours namely: extra hot, hot, mild, lemon &amp; herb and bbq.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The wrap was nice, although not as satisfying as the chicken meal. I thought some extra filling could be added. The wedges were tasty and just as good as the chips.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The Bar-One shake was delicious, thick and not overly sweet. The strawberry mocktail was average but perhaps it would be worth trying their pina colada or passion fruit mocktail next time.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Overall, the atmosphere, service delivery and particularly the chicken meal was great. I would definitely recommend it and would do a repeat visit, perhaps with my family. I must mention that they are extremely reasonably priced for the quality and portions. They come in affordably with a family meal costing between R100-R120 and a single meal costing between R40-R50. They also run great specials so don\u2019t forget to check those out.

On the morning of the last day of our 4 trip we went for a walk on the Sea Point Promenade taking in the joggers, dog walkers and the paragliders landing on the grass lawns as they sailed down from Signal hill. Bo Kaap Deli was a great choice for breakfast. It is located where the old Batavia Cafe used to be, still identifiable by the bright blue colour the building is painted in. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We went quite early and were lucky to get a table inside as it's quite small. There are several tables outside, great for summer but with the chilly May weather your food would be ice cold within minutes. There seemed to be a lot of staff for the small space but it got busier quite quickly and I understood the need for more staff. Our orders were taken promptly by a friendly waitress and while we waited we sipped on a pretty decent Cappucino and latte. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For a small spot it was pretty bustling. While we waited a young group of friends (brunch date) and a family filled up the small space inside. Shortly a group of cyclists pulled up outside, parked their bikes and took up a few more tables outside. I ventured out to take some pics, one never tires of Bo Kaap scenes, and also found the entrance to their upstairs section. A great space for larger groups and funcions. This is also where the bathroom is. Happy to report it was very clean and neat.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I went back down just as the food arrived. We had ordered the Spicy Omelette for me, Chicken Livers with a poached egg for him, and the French Toast with Banana for the kiddo.

But if you like that kick early in the morning, this will do it. The Chicken Livers were also spicy and a definite do again for him. This dish was a nice departure from the usual for breakfast and would also make a decent lunch. The French Toast was a treat although the strawberry jam with pieces in did not really do it for the little guy. I was forced to take over eventually and polish off the rest of the thick eggy slices with the caramelised banana and single cream. It was a tough job but someone had to do it... lol. We bought some Koesisters to take away with us as no Sunday would be complete without it, and there was no space for any more.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Our meal came to a reasonable R370.

Home-made with nothing short of passion, you will have access to gluten-free, dairy-free and refined sugar-free treats. There is a wide range of offerings such as a chocolate hazelnut spread, chocolate brownies, Belgian waffles, muffins, big cakes (vanilla with coconut chocolate ganache and zesty lemon with seasonal fresh berries) and cupcakes with chocolate coconut ganache. In addition, the chocolate hazelnut spread and Belgian waffles have been certified by locally and internationally accredited laboratories to be gluten-free, dairy-free and refined sugar-free.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>BFF foods is a home-based bakery located on the slopes of Table Mountain, in Cape Town. The business was created by Sameera Tayob as a result of digestive distress and a leaky gut diagnosis. As part of her treatment, she was to remove dairy, gluten and refined sugar from her diet. With amazing results, and a complete nutritional lifestyle change, Sameera was able to greatly enhance her quality of life. Through her kitchen experiments, she conjured up tasty treats that looked appetising and tasted amazing! Thus, BFF foods was born. Through her business she wishes to be an advocate for improving gut health thereby creating a drive towards eating better. She wishes to demonstrate that healthy can be tasty too \u2013 you do not have to compromise on flavour.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"center\",\"id\":10426,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/BFF-Foods-Hungry-for-Halaal1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10426\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph {\"backgroundColor\":\"very-light-gray\"} -->\n<p class=\"has-very-light-gray-background-color has-background\">Mission statement:<br>\u201c<em>A positive peaceful holistic life starts with proper nutrition<\/em>.\u201d<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Given BFF\u2019s mission statement, it is important to acknowledge that these treats were conceptualised to treat Sameera\u2019s health issue. While I am no medical expert, my research has indicated that diabetics still need to monitor their sugar intake because natural or unrefined sugars still contribute to a spike in glucose levels. As for those with high cholesterol, monitoring their fat intake, even if natural (such as coconut oil), is still required. It is thus important to consume a balanced diet that takes all food groups into consideration and to eat well according to your individual health needs.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Before I describe my taste journey, I would like to elaborate on the methodology employed by BFF Foods:<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>Gluten-free refers to using almond flour and\/or a gluten free flour blend.<\/li><li>Dairy-free refers to the use of almond milk, coconut milk and coconut cream.<\/li><li>Refined sugar-free refers to the use of coconut blossom sugar, honey, dates and fruit, to naturally sweeten the products.<\/li><\/ul>\n<!-- \/wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I was particularly interested in sampling these treats because I am a gluten and refined sugar-free experimental \u2018baker\u2019 for my family. I have tried many different flours, types of sugars, variants of milk etc, over the years. I have yet to perfect this art. My review is thus based on my experience as a baker and a taster.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Let the taste testing begin: My entire family was excited for this delivery, which arrived in eye-catching packaging. My delivery consisted of the Belgian waffles, the muffins and the brownies. I had the pleasure of sampling all four variants of the muffins \u2013 (1) chocolate, banana and almond, (2) orange, cranberry and almond, (3) banana, cinnamon and pecan, and (4) lemon, chia seed and almond.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Belgian waffles<\/h4>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>True to its name, the BFF Belgian waffle offering is light, generously-sized, with deep pockets. They are fluffy and boast impressive height. They may be stored in the freezer and easily re-heated in the air-fryer, toaster or oven. I re-heated mine in the air-fryer on 180 degrees Celsius for five minutes. These tasty waffles may be topped with anything of your choice. The waffle was particularly enjoyed by my toddler who is a super fussy eater \u2013 attesting to the tastiness of the product.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"center\",\"id\":10427,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/BFF-waffle-Hungry-for-Halaal-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10427\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:gallery {\"ids\":[10428,10429],\"linkTo\":\"none\",\"align\":\"center\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery aligncenter columns-2 is-cropped\"><ul class=\"blocks-gallery-grid\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/BFF-waffle-Hungry-for-Halaal6.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"10428\" data-full-url=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/BFF-waffle-Hungry-for-Halaal6.jpg\" data-link=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/?attachment_id=10428\" class=\"wp-image-10428\"\/><\/figure><\/li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/BFF-waffles-wrapper-Hungry-for-Halaal7.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"10429\" data-full-url=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/BFF-waffles-wrapper-Hungry-for-Halaal7.jpg\" data-link=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/?attachment_id=10429\" class=\"wp-image-10429\"\/><\/figure><\/li><\/ul><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:gallery -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Muffins<\/h4>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The muffins were light, and true to each flavour. They come in a generous serving size (jumbo). What I particularly appreciated was tasting the fruit. The chocolate, banana and almond muffin tasted decadent, with a perfect balance of banana. The orange, cranberry and almond was my favourite, because of the flavour burst of orange, and the little pockets of sweetness offered by the cranberries. The banana, cinnamon and pecan reminded me of good pecan pie, with the perfect amount of sweetness. I am a fan of all things lemon, and the lemon, chia seed and almond muffin did not disappoint. The chia seeds gave the texture synonymous with poppy seeds. These treats are best eaten warm, and if the diet allows, with a light smear of butter.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"center\",\"id\":10430,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/BFF-muffins-Hungry-for-Halaal5.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10430\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Brownies<\/h4>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The brownies were moist, dark and decadent, offering a \u2018melt in your mouth\u2019 sensation. There was a richness that gave me a new-found appreciation for the cocoa bean. This brownie can be eaten as a snack, or converted to a dessert \u2013 my husband asked for ice-cream. It can be eaten warm or at room temperature. I am a fan of flaked almonds \u2013 the brownies had a good amount of these as a topping, adding a lovely crunch to the softness of the brownie.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"center\",\"id\":10431,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/BFF-brownies-Hungry-for-Halaal4.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10431\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"center\",\"id\":10432,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/BFF-brownies-Hungry-for-Halaal3.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10432\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Overall, I give the products a 10\/10. Here\u2019s why: With gluten-free baking it is quite tricky to get the texture \u2018right\u2019. These products have the ideal texture and the flavours are 100% on par had they been the \u2018original\u2019 baked product. If you were not aware, you would not know the difference. In terms of sweetness, the products are perfectly balanced. I appreciate the subtle level of sweetness, while maintaining strong natural flavours. You could purchase the products in bulk, as they freeze well and can be easily re-heated. The products are aesthetically pleasing and well presented. Everything is labelled and the ingredients listed. It is a high-quality product that I strongly recommend. Something that I particularly appreciated, was the level of customer service. Meeting Sameera, hearing her story, coupled with her friendly disposition, you would be naturally inclined to want to support this small, growing business.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>No review would be complete without acknowledging the good and the bad. In my view, the only con is the price. These treats do not come cheap. However, the target market would be well aware of the high cost associated with these ingredients, and I am a firm advocate for quality. BFF Foods is a high-quality offering, and well worth the spend.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Contact details:<\/strong><br>Website: <a href=\"https:\/\/bfffoods.co.za\/\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">https:\/\/bfffoods.co.za\/<\/a><br>Call\/ WhatsApp: 083 447 4048<br>Email: <a href=\"mailto:info@bfffoods.co.za\" target=\"_blank\" aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">info@bfffoods.co.za<\/a><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>How to place an order:<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true,\"type\":\"1\"} -->\n<ol type=\"1\"><li>Email (<a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"mailto:info@bfffoods.co.za\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">info@bfffoods.co.za<\/a>) or WhatsApp (083 447 4048) your order, with a three to four business day notice.

Steeped in history and the melting pot where East meets West, Istanbul or Constantinople as it was called was the centre of the ancient world for hundreds of years. Turkish food reflects this merging of cultures and is neither European bland nor over spicy as expected in typical Eastern gourmet.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>My first experience of Turkish cuisine came from searching for halaal food in not so Muslim friendly European cities like Rome, Paris and Hamburg. The Donner Kebab franchise having saved this meat starved traveler many a time.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Closer to home, there has been several Turkish restaurants and outlets that have graced the shores of South Africa.

For me though I always start with the strong overpowering Turkish Coffee. Literally strong enough to make the spoon stand up straight all on its own in the elegant and intricate cup it is served in.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After months of lockdown and self-imposed restaurant exile, we decided to check out Istanbul Kebab in Sunninghill. This we found out is the new location of the business that had burnt down in Rivonia. It is part of a food court at the Sunninghill Village Shopping Centre. The interior d\u00e9cor is smart, bright and modern with a touch of ornate Turkish flair, brightly coloured lamps, shiny silver finishes and double volume windows reminiscent of their architecture. The key attraction though seems to be the shisha lounge which patrons had to wait to get in. Early evening on a Sunday, this place was surprisingly busy with about half the clientele being middle eastern foreigners.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The waitrons were attentive and efficient though they were lacking a little in advising on the menu. The food came quickly and although appeared slightly expensive on paper, the quantity of food catered for a full meal and then some for takeaway after. So in hindsight the cost of the meal was well worth it. We opted for the Mixed Plate for 2 to 3, a platter of chargrilled, chops, chicken, kebabs and thinly sliced beef. Accompanied by hummus, haydari (yoghurt and herbs), Ezme a tomato based dip sort of like fine kuchambar, salad, butter beans, nutty rice, chips and a basket of plain naan. Delicious with a capital D, nothing on the table was lacking. The hummus was excellent and we even ordered extra to take home.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A lot of Indian people tend to find middle eastern food too bland for the spicy Indian palate. I'm happy to say this was some of the tastiest middle eastern food we have eaten yet. The meat was cooked with that smokey charred depth and was flavourful all on it's own.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Unfortunately, there was little space to try out the desserts, though they did look interesting and the <a href=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/2022\/10\/6-turkish-desserts-you-have-to-try\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Kunafa<\/a> will warrant a second excursion. Our meal came to around R550 for 2 adults and a child . We did have enough to take home for another meal though. Were we 3 adults, this would have been just enough.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The restaurant also has a number of shelves with distinctly Turkish products. It's kind of like the equivalent of finding a shop in Europe that sells Biltong or Mrs. Balls chutney to cater for the homesick South African. Pastas, sauces, chocolates, Turkish delights and those famous Turkish tea and coffee sets.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This is a meal you want to eat slowly, with friends and lots of time to digest and enjoy without interruption, deadlines or schedules.

The Neapolitan style of pizza-making is traditional and serious business. The biggest difference between this style of pizza and the normal pizza we eat everyday is that Neapolitan pizza has a very thin crust at the base with dough that puffs up around the sides giving it a very airy crust. The middle is thin and sags when it\u2019s picked up. So if your pizza does not have the signature sag it won\u2019t cut the mustard.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In Cape Town, Ciao Pizza is one of few spots that specialise in Neapolitan style pizza. They started as&nbsp; a home-based side business for Bashier Sonday. An IT professional who found his passion in food, cheese and pizza. Determined to make the best Neapolitan pizza around he did extensive research and experimentation before being happy with his recipe. He established Ciao Pizza and initially was doing the market scene for a few years. In June this year they opened a rustic brick and mortar store at the end of Long street in Cape Town.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I visited the store in July. It was my first foray eating out in the heart of the Covid-19 pandemic and I was not quite sure what to expect from the experience. The upside of Covid was that I did not have to battle to find parking on the notoriously fully parked Long street.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The store is a small, cosy affair near the end of the street. The inside of the building has been revamped into an eclectic mix of striking modern lighting and wooden beams above a stunning wooden counter and rustic touches of the original building in the way of an old exposed brick wall. Glass windows at the front of the store open horizontally upwards exposing the front counter seating to the warm Cape Town sun and a European feel of sidewalk seating.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I sanitized my hands at the foot operated sanitizing station as I walked in. No one took my temperature as they now do in level 2 and 3 or wrote down my contact details. Only one other table was occupied so I took a seat at the opposite side of the room. Far away enough to feel adequately socially distanced. Small wooden tables and modern metal chairs and stools made for quick meals rather than leisurely lunches occupied the front part of the store. Slightly more comfortable soft seats were available against the back wall for 3 more tables as well.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I ordered a cooling frozen mojito and the signature Margherita pizza from the chalkboards at the counter. The menu is minimal with 6 pizzas and 2 calzones. They have a good range of hot drinks and milkshakes, and while the milkshakes were tempting I left them for another time. The Margherita starts at R90 and goes up to R140 for the Brisket Macon pizza. The calzones are priced at R150 each. Shakes and mocktails are affordable averaging R35.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I watched the staff in their black masks as they got busy behind the counter. From my table I could not really see their work but I was fascinated by the huge pizza oven behind them. Unlike the clay pizza ovens I\u2019ve seen before, this one is tiled in white mosaic style on the outside giving this traditional wood fired oven a distinctly modern spin.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>My pizza arrived and looked just beautiful. The puffy crust with signature fire blisters offset the intense red tomato sauce topped with locally sourced fior de latte mozzarella and fresh basil. I couldn\u2019t wait to tuck in. But as I lifted a slice my uninitiated pizza sense fell as the slice completely sagged and went soft in the middle. The flavour was on point but I could not help feeling the pizza was underdone in the middle. The waiter came over at a point to check on me and I mentioned that I found the pizza too soft in the middle. Not a few minutes later, a fresh pizza was brought to my table that was more well done. This was completely unexpected. I had not sent my pizza back or requested a new one. I was just giving them feedback. The waiter had fed back to the owner Bashier, who had then instructed them to make a new one for me.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I went over to thank him for the gesture, a definite customer service win. And he ended up giving me a quick lesson in the art of the Neapolitan pizza. The saggy centre is a signature of the pizza. And the way it\u2019s meant to be eaten is that you lift the slice with your hands, fold it in the middle down its length, which makes it more sturdy and bite from the pointy end. It\u2019s a rustic style and rejects the use of any knives and forks. I felt rather schooled to be honest. But definitely wiser in my pizza knowledge. If your style of pizza is the like of Pizza Time, a thick base with loaded toppings or the crisp lightness of Col\u2019cacchio, then this may not be the one for you. But it\u2019s such a cute little spot it\u2019s worth the drive into town.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->","post_title":"Ciao Pizza, Cape Town CBD","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"ciao-pizza-cape-town-cbd","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2020-09-17 09:15:36","post_modified_gmt":"2020-09-17 09:15:36","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/?post_type=listing&#038;p=10192","menu_order":0,"post_type":"listing","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"3","filter":"raw"},{"ID":10024,"post_author":"3693","post_date":"2020-07-02 12:23:58","post_date_gmt":"2020-07-02 12:23:58","post_content":"WESTERN CAPE\nCOOK HALAAL\n\nSTRAND \/ GORDONS BAY \/ SOMERSET WEST AREAS\nHalaal Catering Homecooked meals &amp; Savoury Platters.","post_title":"Halaal Homecooked Food, Strand","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"halaal-homecooked-food","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2020-07-02 12:25:55","post_modified_gmt":"2020-07-02 12:25:55","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/?post_type=listing&#038;p=10024","menu_order":0,"post_type":"listing","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},{"ID":9985,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2020-06-24 10:42:30","post_date_gmt":"2020-06-24 10:42:30","post_content":"<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Affordable Luxury Port Elizabeth Beachfront Accommodation<\/h4>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Al-Beit Lodge is situated in the quiet upmarket suburb of Summerstrand, which is mere minutes from the beach, airport and other amenities.

So on went Google Maps and off we\nheaded to Eldo Square, a small shopping centre where they are located.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The day was hot and we arrived to a caf\u00e9 style eatery that was busier than I\nexpected for a Sunday afternoon. I was hoping for an airconned interior but\ninstead they have several large fans mounted high on the walls all blowing at\nfull force. If you sat out of range of the fans it was simply too hot so I put\nup with the slightly uncomfortable wind blowing on our table. The menu is vast\nwith lots of interesting dishes, mostly western or fusion type food. They are\nparticularly known for their decadent desserts though and I had made up my mind\nthat dessert would have to be part of this meal. The menu was filled with\nbeautiful photography of their dishes which made it hard to decide. It was\nearly for supper though and we were not yet that hungry so when Taufeeq decided\nall he wanted was dessert, we negotiated and decided he could have some of our\nmains if he would share his dessert. And seeing the size of his Texan Cookie\nand Brownie Fries platter served with 3 sauces there would be enough to go\naround.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We opted for the Alfredo pasta with chicken and the signature Jalapeno Kremo\nBurger, a cranberry and rose Granita and a coffee frappe. The burger was\ndelicious. The steak nicely done and the sauce tasty with some bite. When the\nalfredo pasta came it looked almost nothing like the photo in the menu. The expected\ngrilled finish with charred and crunchy bits on top looked nothing like the creamy,\nunbaked and splattered dish that was presented. I had made my choice based on\nthe picture so my dissappointment ran deep. My husband took one look at my face\nand knew what was coming. He promptly rolled his eyes and started eating rather\nthan end up with cold food. I addressed my issue with the pasta with my waiter\nwho brought the manager over. They explained that the dish I ordered was in\nfact the same thing as on the menu but it had been over-cooked that way for the\npic. They took my dish back to the kitchen and added some parmesan and grilled\nit slightly to bring it closer to my expectations. It didn\u2019t really work, but I\nmust commend them for their willingness to try. The taste of the pasta was\ndelicious though and for someone who wasn\u2019t that hungry I polished it off with\nTaufeeq\u2019s assistance.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Taufeeq\u2019s dessert of brownie and cookie sticks was served on a wooden board\nwith a shot glass of milk and 3 sauces, caramel, Kinder and Nutella. This a\nnice dessert to share but too much after a full meal as it\u2019s really sweet. I\nwould happily come for this as a coffee and dessert date though. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I like that they innovate with their dishes. The desserts are different. Think, Pistachio Milk Cake, Smores served in a pan, Fried Oreo and Churros platter. They have a healthy eating section which includes Aubergine Parmigianna, Tahini Baked Carrot and Sweet Potato and Luxury Halloumi, Hummus and Avo Wrap. A wide range of breakfast dishes which includes a Bombay breakfast and Shakshouka. Prices are on the high side. Desserts average R80, Pasta R100, Breakfast 65 though their fillet steak is on par with say a Spur at R160. While the aim of the menu is definitely upmarket the ambiance and decor falls short. The vibe is of a casual ice cream shop and eatery. It was noisy due to the fans and the acoustics. I felt like it needed some ambient music but the noise would cancel that out completely. The tables and chairs while neat and clean were of chipboard and lacked the kind of polish to go with the menu. The concept and food is great but I feel they would do well in a more upmarket location with more attention to their finishes in order to attract the market they are going for. These more upmarket type of eateries are lacking in the halaal space and Le Kreamery could well fill that gap with some TLC.  <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Image 6 credit: Zarina Mayet<\/em><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->","post_title":"Le Kreamery, Eldo Glen","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"le-kreamery-eldo-glen","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2023-04-12 13:55:53","post_modified_gmt":"2023-04-12 11:55:53","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/?post_type=listing&#038;p=9892","menu_order":0,"post_type":"listing","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"2","filter":"raw"},{"ID":9510,"post_author":"2633","post_date":"2020-03-12 20:31:39","post_date_gmt":"2020-03-12 20:31:39","post_content":"Authentic Boiled Bagels","post_title":"Bagel Zone, Benmore","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"bagel-zone-benmore","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2020-03-16 13:57:06","post_modified_gmt":"2020-03-16 13:57:06","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/?post_type=listing&#038;p=9510","menu_order":0,"post_type":"listing","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},{"ID":9547,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2020-03-11 21:04:18","post_date_gmt":"2020-03-11 21:04:18","post_content":"<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A decadent dessert shop at the V&amp;A where Myatt used to be.

There are only 2 branches, one here which is certified halaal, and the other in Cornubia, KZN, which is not. We initially sat in the outside section which is undercover but the lighting was bad (blogger issues) so we moved inside so I could take better pics. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We had a super friendly waitress who was very attentive and made sure Taufeeq first had some crayons and a colouring in page.

The patty did not taste like cardboard and Zulfi happily polished this off.  The parmesan fries I would definitely order again. The fries were just the right amount of crispy outside and soft inside and the topping not too overdone. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The wings come in a choice of 18 flavours which can leave you completely confused. I decided to try something different and ordered half the wings in Butter chicken flavour and the other half in the Hot BBQ Sizzling level (There are 5 levels starting with Smiling and ending with Suicidal). Mine was level 2 and I still found it too hot tasting mostly heat. I asked for a sweeter dipping sauce to temper the heat. I couldn't decide which so they brought me a small taster of a few which I thought was great customer service. I loved the Asian Zing with its zesty ginger kick the best. The Butter Chicken wings was a miss for me and I didn't enjoy this flavour. You're only allowed to split your flavour choices if you order 12 or 20 wings. They also have the wings boneless if you're that way inclined, I'm not. And I spotted Cauli wings as a meat-free alternative. I tasted Taufeeq's mac n cheese and while it was a good portion it could have used more flavour. Although, for Taufeeq it was the best thing ever! Why do kids like plain food???<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>They offer 2 or 3 vegetarian options but it really is a meat-eaters dream. There's ribs, rump and lamb chops, sloppy joes, nachos and a Colossal burger that includes 3 beef patties. Old school shakes are about R45, R30 for kids, but the crazy shakes average a whopping R75! Waffles look very tempting but they will keep for another trip. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Burgers and chips don't come together. You order your burger, average R75 and fries start at R22. I like that they also have Zucchini and Sweet Potato fries as an option. Our bill came to R403 which is not a cheap meal out. Very little is nowadays. But I liked the vibe and service and will go again.

Now having migrated to Jozi for work, Cape Town is now a holiday destination with the family in December and those quick business trips where you try and fit in work as well as catching up with friends and that all-important family drive by. It's always good catching up with loved ones but it makes for a long day after spending a full day at work. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>On a recent trip I found myself staying in a guesthouse in Bellville just off Old Oak Street off the N1 and having had a lussie for home food, I decided I would try a very new takeaway called Mas'ud\u2019s Kitchen. Tucked away in Durbanville and only recently having opened they can be found on Facebook and it's been doing the rounds on WhatsApp too. Their speciality is curries and all dishes come with rice and roti or naan as an optional extra. The servings are two sizes but whichever you choose, know that you are getting a serving to share. After all Indian food can\u2019t be eaten alone. I placed my order via WhatsApp and promptly got a response and a pick-up time. I arrived a little early so I could check out the place and was met by Masud and his wife with hot food ready packed and waiting. I was under strict instructions from H4H management that I ensure I get good pics of the food for this article. So whilst chatting with Mas'ud, Nafisa obliged and unwrapped the curries for a quick photo opportunity. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The service industry is not for sissies and on some level, I can identify with the difficulties and hardship found in restaurant and takeaway environment. It takes a special type of person to make a name for themselves and usually, this has happened over many many years. Mas'ud explained how he has been in the restaurant industry for many years having run some fairly well known Indian restaurants prior to going on his own. He has been fortunate he says that some of his previous customers have supported his new venture. That speaks of the quality of the food and service he has brought to the takeaway. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"center\",\"id\":9469,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/Masuds-Kitchen-Hungry-for-Halaal3.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9469\"\/><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I wanted to try both chicken and lamb and thought a little veg curry would round off the meal nicely. The Chicken Goa was creamy with a spicy tang. I opted for the hot and would scale at a 3\/5 in strength. Hot enough to enjoy the meal without requiring CPR or a fire extinguisher after the meal. The Lamb Madras, I ordered mild and it was kid-friendly. Again the flavour was smooth and went down very nicely with roti. The Aloo Matter accompanied the other two dishes nicely. Not being a rice fan especially at night, I was pleasantly surprised at the lightness of it. We were five adults and two growing young boys and the three dishes were ample and filling. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The cost of the dishes ranged from R70 to R85 each depending on the serving size seemed fairly reasonable considering it fed seven people.

Luckily for us, we are no longer limited to\njust Simply Asia. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For some time now I had been driving by a tiny new Thai\nrestaurant on Imam Haron Road, located directly opposite Livingstone High\nSchool. It never crossed my mind that the restaurant may be fully halaal, until\none day I saw a small halaal sign in the window. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I decided to try it out that same weekend. I opted for a\ntakeaway as my family and I preferred to stay in on that Friday evening. The\none thing to note is parking may be somewhat of a problem. When I entered, I\nwas warmly welcomed by the owner, who is originally from Thailand herself. We\nstarted chatting and she was able to point me in the right direction on which\ndishes to try. The menu has a good selection of items and there is something to\nsatisfy all tastebuds. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Taste Test: <\/h4>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For starters I ordered the crispy chicken wontons served\nwith sweet chilli sauce as well as the sweet corn cakes which are also served\nwith sweet chilli sauce. The wontons came highly recommended, so I had to give\nit a try. It goes without saying that it definitely did not disappoint. The\nsweet corn cakes are very similar to the ones at Simply Asia, although very\ntasty, I did find it to be a bit too oily. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For mains, I chose two noodle dishes. One was a prawn Phad\nThai and the other was the chicken Ba Me Prik Phao. The Phad Thai had rice\nnoodles and Phad Thai sauce and was served with some lemon and dry chilli\nflakes on the side. Needless to say, I went to town with the chilli as I love\nspicy food. I thoroughly enjoyed the Phad Thai, it was flavoursome and\nauthentic, something I would easily repeat on a follow up visit. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The Ba Me Prik Phao was stir-fried with yellow noodles,\nvegetables and cashews in a roasted chilli paste. By the ingredients I assumed\nit was similar to the 514 at Simply Asia. This dish also came recommended by\nthe owner and is said to be a popular number with customers. I found it to be\ntasty but felt it lacked the wow factor that the Phad Thai had. Perhaps this\nwould be great for those who don\u2019t like a kick. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To round off the evening, I ordered the fried ice cream. I\nhad never tried fried ice cream before and when I saw it on the menu, my decision\nwas instant. My only concern was that it would melt enroute home. Thankfully,\nthe owner was so accommodating and packaged it so well that it was still\nperfect when I arrived at home. The fried ice cream was a delicious way to\nround off the meal. The taste of the ice cream and batter were complimentary\nand worked well together. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If Authentic Thai Cuisine is <g class=\"gr_ gr_3 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"3\" data-gr-id=\"3\">up<\/g> your alley, go give Khao Hom a try and be sure to have it there. <br><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>By Rafieka Banderker<br><\/strong>Accountant by profession, writer at heart.

And as a result, it also has a growing restaurant scene. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Bagel Street, formerly known as Kahawa Caffe has been around for about a year. They have been revamping their space and tweaking their menu and we got to try some of the new items on offer. They are all about bagels and home to the original New York Bagel.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The space used to be a Vape lounge that has now been split with the Vape shop\/lounge at the front that you pass through on your way to the restaurant. The restaurant with <g class=\"gr_ gr_13 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling multiReplace\" id=\"13\" data-gr-id=\"13\">it's<\/g> cobalt blue walls, ash wood laminate floors, and neutral colours in the furniture and fittings give a fresh and bright feeling to <g class=\"gr_ gr_11 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar only-del replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"11\" data-gr-id=\"11\">the space<\/g>. It's not very large with maybe about 7 or 8 tables that can take about 20 to 30 people. The weekday crowd seems to be a bit thin. We were there at 10 on a Thursday morning and only one other table was occupied. But we were told that they get really busy on weekends and people tend to queue for a table. They also do quite a bit of delivery orders via UberEats and OrderIn.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The owner, Uncle Haroon, welcomed us and made some suggestions on what was popular. He is obviously passionate about this business and has invested huge time and energy into getting every aspect of the menu, and service just right. Bagel Street is different in that it serves everything on a bagel. They have Bagelizzas, yes that's the pizza version of a bagel; all-day breakfast on a bagel; beef burgers and chicken burgers, but not on a bun, on a bagel. They even have dessert bagels. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We tried a simple <g class=\"gr_ gr_11 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace\" id=\"11\" data-gr-id=\"11\">Margerita<\/g> Bagelizza first. The bagel was good, not too thick or too stodgy. They make their bagels the authentic way, by boiling and baking and you can taste the difference. As a bagel should be, it was <g class=\"gr_ gr_14 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace\" id=\"14\" data-gr-id=\"14\">more dense<\/g> than a bun, but this one was not so dense that it felt overly heavy. We then chose the 5th Avenue (Philly Steak) and the East Side (Spicy chicken with Onion Rings). The Philly Steak was beautifully done and Uncle Haroon revealed that they use only a particular cut of beef from a specific section of the cow to make this with. No amount of prodding could get him to reveal it though. The sauce was slightly sweet with sauteed onion and jalapenos. They use the authentic recipe Provolone cheese melted all over this filling which has a subtle but distinctive flavour unlike the blandness of mozzarella. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The East Side was spicy with no sweetness which was great as a contrast to the Philly Steak. If you don't like sweetness on your meat then this is a good option. Both were served with a portion of skinny cut fries on wooden boards. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We had both had a flat white before our meal and were now too full to even attempt a dessert bagel. They use the Bean There brand of beans which makes a pretty decent flat white, though I personally like my brew a tad stronger.

Such was the case with Ozzy\u2019s Kitchen. Which is why my first foray to this Jozi hot spot only happened after 7 months of living in Johannesburg. Run by Ozzy Osman who honed his chef skills in the Masterchef SA kitchen, I was filled with anticipation. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It was a Saturday afternoon in January with some time to kill in Sandton\nthat we decided to venture over. No reservation, but we were going to live\ndangerously. Lady luck was on our side, because we arrived at 3pm and were able\nto choose a table. It was not busy but not exactly quiet either. And it filled\nup a bit more after that. We soon learned that lady luck was not just on our\nside but had been graciously escorting us as well because after receiving our\nstarters and putting in our mains order we learned that they stop serving at\n4pm in order to prep for dinner at 6pm. And dinner I was later to learn is\ntypically fully booked, and had we pitched without a reservation we would have\nhad a long wait ahead.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The location of the restaurant is in Wynberg, an industrial area in Sandton.\nWe went in the afternoon but I imagine it\u2019s not a great spot at night. They do\nhave secure parking around the back of the restaurant though. The restaurant\nitelf is part of a block with an art gallery upstairs and what looked like\noffices adjoining. The space is warehouse chic with concrete floors, brick\nwalls and large cavernous spaciousness. It\u2019s slick, but lacks the intimacy you\nmay want for a romantic setting. But what it lacks in elegance it makes up for\nin a menu infused with bold presentation, flavour and creativity. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We opted to share the Bang Bang Shrimp starter. A wise choice as this dish came with 9 decent size tempura prawns(the menu said 6) on a bed of slaw with a sriracha sauce. The flavours of this dish was faultless and could happily suffice as a main meal for me in future. While waiting for our starter, we were offered a slate of pita bread wedges with hummus and a kidney bean pat\u00e9. I must admit that while beautifully presented, I wasn\u2019t overly wowed with either of the spreads, finding both a bit lacking in flavour. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After the December holidays, following an onslaught of <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"braaing (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/2019\/12\/the-braai-gurus-guide-to-the-perfect-steak\/\" target=\"_blank\">braaing<\/a> and family get-togethers which included more braaing I was a bit \u201cmeated out\u201d. So where I normally would have tried a steak as a measure of skill, I opted for their signature Mozambican peri-peri chicken instead. The chicken was moist and tender and the sauce was something else, tangy, hot and spicy. I chose the roasted veggies on the side instead of chips and can I just say at the risk of sounding like I\u2019m gushing, Ozzy\u2019s skills are apparent when such a simple side is elevated so you can see the care and thought that went into its preparation. The roast veggies were freshly cut, not out of a freezer bag, and so perfectly done and seasoned it almost deserved its own place on the menu. We also tried the Moroccon Burger - a Brioche Bun, Lamb Patty, Tzatziki, Mint Sauce &amp; Crumbled Feta. Hubby thoroughly enjoyed this but my chicken beat it hands down. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The menu includes breakfast, pasta, salads, grills and seafood.

Prices are not so outlandish as I was led to believe. My half chicken was R90 and the Burger was R89. Some menu items are quite pricey but most are on par with other restaurants of it\u2019s type. I did find the kids menu a little pricey. Considering how small children eat, Fish Nuggets for R79 is a bit steep. Mocktails and drinks were reasonably priced. I loved that they have a kids area which I did not expect. And it\u2019s quite large with big windows you can watch the kids through and emblazoned with colouful graffiti. Service was good, efficient, friendly and not invasive.  There\u2019s a bunch of menu items that look interesting that I still want to try so Ozzy\u2019s will definitely be a do-again for me. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->","post_title":"Ozzy's Kitchen, Sandton","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"ozzys-kitchen-sandton","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2020-11-10 08:07:19","post_modified_gmt":"2020-11-10 08:07:19","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/?post_type=listing&#038;p=8561","menu_order":0,"post_type":"listing","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},{"ID":8544,"post_author":"1558","post_date":"2019-08-30 10:33:19","post_date_gmt":"2019-08-30 10:33:19","post_content":"<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Launched in 1992, Calisto\u2019s is a Portuguese sit down restaurant offering flamed grilled Portuguese chicken, seafood and meat, with meals that are freshly prepared in the traditional Portuguese way using only the freshest, finest ingredients available.

Trendy family run Portuguese food outlet situated in Woodstock Cape Town. Serving high quality grilled chicken, burgers, seafood and much more.\n\nHOUSE REVIEW - Senhor Calistos, Woodstock\nNovember 2015\n\nSenhor Calistos was an accidental find in our quest for fish and chips one Saturday. We had popped in to Fishaways on the Main road in Woodstock and just two doors down Senhor Calistos caught my eye. I looked unfamiliar but interesting so I popped over and took a gander. Today's photo's not so great. In my defence, I was ravenous and took them in a hurry so I could tuck in.\n\nThe first thing I thought when I went inside was that it had a very Nando's feel. Portuguese flame grilled chicken seemed the main offering but here's the bait that got me hook, line and sinker - fried squid heads! Those crispy little critters that you only used to get at Ocean Basket are available here as well. Turns out, they do seafood as well. Even prawns and crayfish. My salivary glands activated I proceeded to place a second order for lunch along with the Fishaways order we had already placed. Prawns and chips, a side of crispy critters and a chicken burger cos we had to taste test. Note, they've added a South African spin to the Portuguese with pap and gravy as an alternative to chips or rice.\n\nWhile waiting for our order we took a look around the space. There was an adjoining seating area which was nicely furnished in warm colours and wooden tables. There's a new branch which just opened in Goodwood as well and the setup there looks even better and a bit bigger. There are several branches in Jozi, but their website is down at the moment and from what I could tell from the net, only the Norwood branch is halaal. In Cape Town, both the Woodstock and Goodwood branches are halaal.\n\nOur prawns took a bit long but the owner assured us it was worth the wait. We collected the order and and headed home. Our food was still lukewarm after the 25 minute drive and in future I will rather eat at the venue if I order prawns. But truth be told, it was some of the best prawns I've had in a long time. Tasty, succulent and a solid size. Not those dinky little things that pass for large prawns at some famous establishments. The marinade was spicy and tangy. The extra chilli on the side was super hot and deserved it's own photo as you can see. The chips were chunky and rustic and the squid heads did not disappoint. Only the burger did not impress. I found it a bit too messy and taste just did not measure up after the prawns. Perhaps I should try it again on it's own. Just writing this post has me making a mental note to check out the Goodwood branch this very weekend.\n\nThe Double D burger\n<div class=\"separator\"><a href=\"http:\/\/4.bp.blogspot.com\/-cvj7f7Qxm4g\/VjvDJGzMz0I\/AAAAAAAAF9s\/XQdKqe0PgKI\/s1600\/12170485_501553240025568_1511401457_n.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/4.bp.blogspot.com\/-cvj7f7Qxm4g\/VjvDJGzMz0I\/AAAAAAAAF9s\/XQdKqe0PgKI\/s640\/12170485_501553240025568_1511401457_n.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<div class=\"separator\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"separator\">The Jalapeno and Cheese burger<\/div>\n<div class=\"separator\"><a href=\"http:\/\/2.bp.blogspot.com\/-b6bOMZk4At0\/VjvDIXrlciI\/AAAAAAAAF9k\/ck-gF689PTI\/s1600\/10462375_155142478171441_875236771263865898_n.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/2.bp.blogspot.com\/-b6bOMZk4At0\/VjvDIXrlciI\/AAAAAAAAF9k\/ck-gF689PTI\/s640\/10462375_155142478171441_875236771263865898_n.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a><\/div>\nPrices are much like Nandos.

We were seated\nat a table of our choosing as they were not very busy at all. The d\u00e9cor inside\nis that of a cosy family restaurant. The dark green and red colours were\ndeepened by low lighting for the dinner crowd. A bloggers nightmare but great\nfor mellow evening ambiance. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Our waiter was attentive, upbeat and knew\nthe menu well. He was good at sussing us out and suggested we try the platter\nfor 2 offer which comes with a starter and dessert to share, 2 mocktails and a\nplatter for 2 for R550. The platter is served in a chaffing dish kept warm with\na burner underneath and comes with 6 prawns, half a peri peri chicken, their\nrump in the oven steak with chips and rice. They serve their signature sauce on\nthe side and also brought me a lemon butter sauce, which I had heard much about\nwhen I enquired about it. The prawns which come with a creamy sauce on top is\neasily some of the best prawns I\u2019ve had. The lemony Portuguese flavour coming\nthrough without too much heat. The steak which is cut similar to hasselback\npotatoes had an excellent flavour, just the right amount of lemony, smokey\nchilliness. The peri peri chicken had almost a tikka flavour and was also very\ngood. We had asked for the hot version of this main but I did not find any of\nwhat we ate to be seriously hot. The heat was quite manageable, even for our\nCape Town palates. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We were going to choose the stuffed\ncalamari starter to share but our waiter suggested we do the fried halloumi\ninstead as he thought the calamari was too small a portion to share. The\nstarter was artfully presented but I found the halloumi itself a bit dry. Before\nthe starter came we saw they had a small salaah room near the front which\npeople had been using as it was around magrib time.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For dessert we could choose from one of the cakes in the display cabinet. We opted for the many layered Mozart cake which was served with cream and ice cream. This was really good but alas could not be finished. A strong espresso was needed afterwards to cut through all the richness and did the trick quite nicely.

This time as an espresso the flavour and strength was much better.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The bill came with a 10% gratuity added on\nalready.

They also have a clay oven for pizzas and a small pasta menu. I spotted traditional dishes like Mozambican Crab Curry, Espetada and Bacalhau. The Bacalhau dishes need to be pre-ordered and are pricier at about R180. Most of the other mains average at R120 to R150. They have a kids menu for the under 12\u2019s.

Saray is well known for authentic Turkish food and is popular with lovers of shisha. The feel of Eatstanbul is quite different though from the original restaurant Saray.

It filled up quite quickly after\nthat so it seemed we just missed the rush hour and may have waited for a table\nif we were later than that. They had just opened for a month so novelty status\nwould keep them busy for a while. Our waiter seated us at a table I chose for\ngood lighting\u2026 blogger hazard, lol. The menu has flavours straight from\nIstanbul. Traditional mezes, such as hummus and falafel accompanied by Turkish\nbreads. There are also kebabs which are prepared over coal grills and G\u00fcve\u00e7\n(seasonal vegetables cooked in a clay pot) as a signature main course. For dessert\nyou can expect a small variety of traditional style sweets like sticky sweet\nbaklava and s\u00fctla\u00e7 (traditional Turkish rice pudding).<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We ordered Corba, a lentil soup starter which I basically swooned over, the\nspicy flavour hit just the right notes but the bread that accompanied it felt a\nbit heavy. For the little munchkin we ordered an egg pide which was the closest\nthing to a simple pizza on the menu and this bread was light and delicious.\nPeople with young kids will know how tricky it is to take them to unusual\nplaces where you\u2019re not sure if the type of food will go down with them.\nThankfully, pides are quite simple and worked out well as he loved it. This is\nalso a great option for a starter for 2 or 3 people. They have pides in a\nvariety of flavours for about R80 each.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The meze you can combine your own at about R45 per item like humus, falafel\netc or their platter with a variety on it is R160. For mains we opted for\nIstanbul Nazik, pan fried beef pieces served over a yoghurt and aubergine\npuree. I would order this again. The aubergine was creamy and I enjoyed the\nsmokey flavour. I had the Adana, a spicy lamb kebab served with shredded\nlettuce, carrot and onion on a turkish flatbread. This was accompanied by rice\nand chips. I encountered this at Saray as well with one of their other dishes.\n3 starches on the plate seems like a lot of carbs to me but must be a\ntraditional thing. Mains on average are about R140. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Service was really good. The waiters knew their menu and when I mentioned\nthat my dish seemed dry and could use some kind of garlic sauce, they made an\neffort to bring me some crushed garlic which I could mix into the mayo on the\ntable. This made a difference to my dish which I enjoyed more this way.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>They have a breakfast menu but only open at <g class=\"gr_ gr_63 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Style multiReplace\" id=\"63\" data-gr-id=\"63\">11am<\/g>. So perhaps good for a brunch. During the day they screen the shisha section from the main restaurant but at night they leave the screens open.

There is a lounge area at the front and I liked that they also had just occasional chairs and side tables for when you don't want a meal and can just enjoy a coffee and a chat.

Upcycled Caf\u00e9, in the heart of Benoni is one such place that if you\u2019re travelling to Johannesburg would be a tragedy to leave off your gastronomic roadmap.\n\nI had come across this caf\u00e9 online and was immediately intrigued by the upcycled inspired d\u00e9cor. So when I visited the City of Gold in March, I simply had to pay a visit. Halaal spots are typically centred around South and Central Johannesburg in places like Fordsburg, also known as \u2018Foodsburg\u2019 or in Lenasia, a predominently Muslim area. The more affluent areas like Sandton and Houghton are also seeing a rise in the amount of halaal venues available. So it\u2019s unusual to find a destination spot like Upcycled Caf\u00e9 in the East and in Benoni no less.\n\nI call it a destination spot because it\u2019s not the kind of place that you just go for the food. The creative owners have poured their energy into every piece of furniture and d\u00e9cor in the place. It\u2019s where the ordinary has gotten a little \u2018extra\u2019. Every item of furniture has been repurposed from something that may have just ended up in the scrap yard. Think of a loveseat for 2 made of an old 1950\u2019s style car fender. Chairs fashioned from vintage wooden cooldrink crates made comfortable with bright pillows and fabrics. Consol glass jar lights suspended into a chandelier made from an old distressed wooden coca cola box. The walls are peppered with with box mounted photographs of scenes from their journeys overseas. There is simply no end to the visual stimulation.\n\nAn examination of the menu was very short because I took one look at the breakfast options and knew immediatley what I wanted \u2013 Masala Eggs like Grandma use to make \u2013 Spicy Scrambled eggs served with a side of spicy potoato, sausages and a Puff Paratha. Was there even a choice? I think not. Zulfi had the Hipster Heaven which was Avocado Toast on wholegrain topped with flaked Hot Rock Salmon, 2 poached eggs, pickled purple onion petals and toasted seeds. Both of these dishes were standout dishes on their own. The Masala eggs had lots of dhanya in it and the potatoes flavoured with whole mustard. The sausage which I am picky about was very good but I do find that sausage and cold meat products from Johannesburg and Durban are generally better than in Cape Town. The paratha, flaky and buttery. This was comfort food at it\u2019s best and sure to lift the spirits of anyone missing mom\u2019s cooking. Not badly priced at R80. The Hipster Heaven Avo toast was delicious but in a much more fresh and healthy way. The saltiness of the salmon went down well with the creaminess of the avo. I felt the poached eggs were just slightly overdone. I like them quite runny. But the toasted seeds were divine. Almost pralined and generously sprinkled over the top. This was R85. The menu also includes burgers, pizza, light meals, bruschetta, sandwiches and mocktails.\n\nI found the location of Upcycled Caf\u00e9 a bit unusual. This type of creativity and attention to detail is more typically found in upscale malls and hippie suburbs. So being situated in an old retail building next to a bakery (Lazeeza\u2019s, also owned by them by the way), a pharmacy and supermarket\/takeaway behind a mosque in Mackenzie Park felt a bit incongruous. After striking up a conversation with Saaleha, the owner and creative brain behind it all, I learned that are soon planning to move to a new location on Atlas Road in the Benoni area.\n\nSaaleha had brought out some sweet treats which was displayed under glass domes on a table at the counter to entice you into something decadent after your meal. Lord knows, it doesn\u2019t take much to twist my rubber arm and before you know it I had added a ricotta and lemon tea cake, honey and orange blossom madeleine and a spicy tea to round off breakfast. At this point, it stops becoming breakfast seeing that it includes dessert right? Both items were artfully presented on their plates and the tea was served in an on trend clay teapot. The lemon and ricotta tea cake was light and delicious, and I could taste the orange blossom honey that the madelein had been syruped with.

In fact, I can be a tad over-critical according to my long-suffering friends. So when I find something I really like I am very happy to get behind it. I first tasted the Ooh Fudge! fudge (sorry, couldn\u2019t resist), about 2 years ago at a friends place and later that year made sure I bought some at the Christmas market at the <a href=\"http:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/top-5-halaal-restaurants-in-cape-town-2018\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cape Town<\/a> Gardens. But after that, they went a little quiet and were nowhere to be found.\n\nSo what\u2019s so special about their fudge anyway you may be thinking. Well if you\u2019re picturing those sugary cubes you get in big jars on shop counters you will be happy to know it\u2019s anything but. Remember the American Fudge Factory? Those super-soft logs of chocolaty fudge that you watched the guys make on marble slabs in the malls? Ok, unless you were born in the eighties you probably have no recollection. But this fudge has the same dreamy melt in the mouth texture. Made with a white chocolate base it has a soft, smooth creaminess and is not sugary at all.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Ooh-Fudge-Launch-Hungry-for-Halaal8.png\"><img class=\" wp-image-7691 aligncenter\" src=\"http:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Ooh-Fudge-Launch-Hungry-for-Halaal8.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"606\" height=\"395\"><\/a>\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Ooh-Fudge-Launch-Hungry-for-Halaal5.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-7688 aligncenter\" src=\"http:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Ooh-Fudge-Launch-Hungry-for-Halaal5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"610\" height=\"813\"><\/a>\n\nZulfa Cassiem is the inspired woman behind this product. While battling with health issues and fending off depression she turned to getting creative in the kitchen. To stave off an anxiety attack she mixed up a batch of fudge one day and shared it with family and friends. They loved it and as a form of therapy Zulfa continued making fudge and adjusted the recipe to have a chocolate base. She tried different flavours and was encouraged to start selling it, and so, Ooh Fudge! was born.\n\nShe is excited by experimenting in the kitchen and spends time coming up with fun and interesting flavours. The fudge is hand-crafted and Zulfa puts a lot of love into what she does. Her wish is that the person buying her fudge enjoys eating it as much as she enjoys creating it.\n\nZulfa took a short hiatus last year and now Ooh Fudge! is back on the market. They have rebranded, re-packaged and revitalized. We found them at the Kenilworth Racecourse Prawn Festival recently where they were re-launching and offering tasters, which we were just too happy to try.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Ooh-Fudge-Launch-Hungry-for-Halaal3.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-7686 aligncenter\" src=\"http:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Ooh-Fudge-Launch-Hungry-for-Halaal3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"610\" height=\"458\"><\/a>\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Ooh-Fudge-Launch-Hungry-for-Halaal2.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-7685 aligncenter\" src=\"http:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Ooh-Fudge-Launch-Hungry-for-Halaal2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"610\" height=\"458\"><\/a>\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Ooh-Fudge-Launch-Hungry-for-Halaal4.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-7687 aligncenter\" src=\"http:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Ooh-Fudge-Launch-Hungry-for-Halaal4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"610\" height=\"813\"><\/a>\n\nThey have 16 awesome flavours for grown-ups like Blueberry &amp; Cream, Cherry Berry, Hazelnut Cappucino, even Liquorice and my personal favourite, Toasted Coconut. Their fun flavours for kids and grown-up kids too include Fizzer Fudge, Funfetti and Unicorn Fudge amongst others.\n\nThe fudge comes individually wrapped in 40g bars at R10 each or packed into branded little boxes of 9 selected flavours for R40.

Despite a reasonably well developed Muslim community, it\u2019s still a challenge to find good halaal restaurants in the area. Bustas Foodhub is one of the few halaal establishments in Paarl who are discerning themselves with a menu a cut above the average takeaway.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to twist my arm too hard to drive out to the Boland. It is after all one of the Cape\u2019s most scenic routes. So we took a leisurely drive out to Paarl to sample some of the wares from this outlet making a name for itself on Instagram lately.\n\nRun by husband and wife team, Abdul Manaan and Shabnum Gaffoor, they had originally started in sleepy Wellington and then moved the business to Paarl, further north and only slightly less sleepy. Their spot on Lady Grey street in the busy centre of town is ideal and they get a cross section of customers from blue collar to corporates to families.\n\nAt first glance the set-up is very much like a typical fast food joint, although the menu stretches across one entire wall and looks vast. On closer inspection though you\u2019ll spot some interesting things on the menu. They\u2019ve tapped into their Indian roots and created a fusion of sorts between typical Cape Town fast food dishes like the humble chip roll and traditional Indian flavours like green chillies and dhanya chutney.\n\nWe had a seat at one of 3 tables for people eating in. There is space for more tables but it\u2019s not their main focus. I couldn\u2019t help thinking there was decent space to have comfortable booth seating which would make this a good sit down experience. With there being so few options in the area this would be a nice addition for locals from the area as well as tourists like us.\n\nBut on to the important stuff, the food. We simply had to try the chip roll fusion called the Chillie Chippie Wrap, which is chips wrapped in a roti with their house sauce and green chutney. It\u2019s usually served like a salomie but they cut it for us to show what was inside. I loved the green chutney flavour. It was like eating something I had made at home. At R27 it\u2019s R10 more expensive than a chip roll but I\u2019d take a roti over a roll any day.\n\nThe Pizza Burger is also something unique that they do. The top of a roll is hollowed out and filled with pizza filling and topped with cheese. Their new flavor was Tikka Chicken which was spicy without being too hot. There are various flavours and are good value from about R27 for vegetarian to R35 for steak, served with chips on the side.\n\nDon\u2019t want to mix your pizza\u2019s and burgers, they also do regular pizzas. We tried the new deboned Rib pizza which had their secret house sauce which for me was a little bit like a dhanya sauce. Not the neon green variety you can buy in the supermarket, but a good quality homemade sauce. I also like the sweet sourness from the pineapple on the topping. I know that ribs are all about the fat as well as the meat, but I didn\u2019t quite enjoy the little bits of rib fat that I could taste. But I know rib lovers will enjoy this one.\n\nAnd then there were actual ribs. You don\u2019t normally get ribs at a fast food place but like I said their menu is not typical. The ribs had really good flavour and though they were just a tad tough still they were sticky and saucy and left you wanting more. It\u2019s served with a good portion of chips at R60 for 200g.\n\nAnd of course, no self-respecting take away doesn\u2019t have a Toasted Masala Steak Sandwich. They toast their bread without butter so you don\u2019t end up with a greasy mess in your hands. The masala steak has a proper old school flavor without sweetness, like something you\u2019d make at home. This sandwich is not shy and filled with steak, egg, chips and salad, will not leave you hungry.\n\nThey cater for kids with smaller kid friendly meals and even have some breakfast options. And the piece de resistance, you\u2019ll be glad to know that you can now also get a good Falooda this far north of the Southern Suburbs.\n\nThe owners are very hands on and spend time developing their menu and trying new things. This spot has the makings of a sit down restaurant or even a Roadhouse. They could easily be like a Wembley in the Boland.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWe were invited to try this restaurant. All opinions are strictly our own.","post_title":"Bustas Food Hub, Paarl","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"bustas-food-hub-paarl","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2022-01-26 23:00:28","post_modified_gmt":"2022-01-26 21:00:28","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/?post_type=listing&#038;p=7670","menu_order":0,"post_type":"listing","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"1","filter":"raw"},{"ID":7538,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2019-02-05 01:25:39","post_date_gmt":"2019-02-04 23:25:39","post_content":"This Restaurant serves a variety of Indian and Punjabi dishes.

Bootlegger Coffee Company has long since been the go to place for those who won't settle for mediocre coffee. Now we'll also be able to enjoy their fully halaal coffee shop menu at their Three Anchor Bay store which has been converted into an ICSA certified halaal store.<\/span>\n\nThe store is located right at the beginning of the busy Sea Point Main Road opposite the Life Church. We popped in on a week day in December last year and they were full inside. It's not a very big venue so it would easily fill up. Quite a few people were there with laptops so I reckon people stick around and use it as a remote office of sorts. It was a little windy outside so I wasn't too keen to take an outside table though on a sunny day these would be great. We were three people and one or two 4-seater tables were occupied by only two people. Our waitress gently asked one of them if she could move them to a 2-seater and the swop was easily made.\n\nThe Bootlegger vibe is a cross between classic, dark woody coffee lounge and trendy yuppy hangout. It's for serious coffee drinkers. They use select beans from Guatamala and Costa Rica and there own specific roasting method. The <span id=\"4ff1b613-f991-4d92-82a8-7ee7cc7c3edb\" class=\"GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark\"><span id=\"2112dd7c-7d48-47a2-9def-b0503aeb8e8d\" class=\"GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark\">blend<\/span><\/span> displays hints of toasted hazelnut, caramel and a subtle touch of dark chocolate. The beans are <span id=\"8f526909-c8f5-43d8-b3d4-a2c8974e8d0e\" class=\"GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark\"><span id=\"8bb0b89a-0236-4fc5-966b-c20ab2aa67a6\" class=\"GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark\">roasted fresh everyday and the coffee<\/span><\/span> served in a glass.\n\n<span title=\"Edited\">The menu is larger than expected. The coffee menu includes milkshakes, juices and tea and other speciality drinks. The food menu comprises no less than 23 breakfast dishes, and that's besides the DIY breakfast section, burgers, salads, bowls, sandwiches and cafe main meals. I chose the Harissa Lamb Burger which was served on a bed of Rocket and topped with crispy onion rings. This was tasty and the harissa sauce was delicious. The onion rings and chips were perfectly done. We also tried the Chicken livers peri peri which is served on buttered ciabatta and topped with a poached egg. This creamy Portuguese style dish was tangy and yummy. I'm not one for livers but the sauce was good. Taufeeq decided he was not into actual food that day and insisted on having pancakes for lunch. His stack of pancakes were generous and served with chocolate sauce and maple syrup. This was not a menu item but when he turned up his nose at a muffin, scone or banana bread the waiter told me they can also do pancakes. It was a total winner. The pancakes were thick and fluffy and just what a six year old wants for lunch.\n<\/span>\n\nThe burger is a bit on the expensive side at R119. The cafe main meals average about R80. Breakfast starts from R59 for Hummus toast to R99 for the The BootEgger breakfast to R115 for the new A\u00e7a\u00ed Bowl with a\u00e7a\u00edberries, strawberries, blueberries, banana, apple, chia and almond milk. Suffice it to say traditional tastes as well as health fundis are all catered for.\n\nThey didn't have a kids menu and though you don't think of Bootlegger as a family hangout they will need to consider adding more kid friendly options in their halaal stores as Muslim people tend to eat out as families. I'm really looking forward to seeing more halaal branches popping up soon.\n\n<em>Original Review: January 2019<\/em>","post_title":"Bootlegger Coffee Shop, Three Anchor Bay","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"bootlegger-coffee-shop-three-anchor-bay","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2023-11-21 15:15:40","post_modified_gmt":"2023-11-21 13:15:40","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/?post_type=listing&#038;p=7449","menu_order":0,"post_type":"listing","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"4","filter":"raw"},{"ID":7325,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2018-11-12 11:13:04","post_date_gmt":"2018-11-12 09:13:04","post_content":"Distinguished Barista is a mobile Coffee Cart offering a full espresso bar service at your venue.

Yes, it\u2019s called Lebanese Bakery in case you were waiting for the name.<\/p>\n<p>Run by Nicky who is Capetonian and her husband Shawki, of Lebanese origin, the Lebanese Bakery is small and quaint. It is almost deli style and minimalist with a clay pizza oven within view of the seating in which the breads are freshly made. There is a striking painting of a refugee child behind the counter which really grabs your attention.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Lebanese-Bakery-Hungry-for-Halaal10.jpeg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-7313 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Lebanese-Bakery-Hungry-for-Halaal10.jpeg\" alt=\"Lebanese Bakery Hungry for Halaal\" width=\"610\" height=\"813\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The menu is succinct with 3 main items and variations of these. They offer Manakish, a Middle Eastern Flatbread which can be served open or folded. The Manakish is available in various flavours such as Zaatar, Labneh, Cheese and Veggie. It is also offered with meat as a second type of variation, called Sfiha and Kafta. The next item is the Fatayer which is a Middle Eastern pie stuffed with either cheese or spinach. Lastly the piece de resistance came in the form of a Middle Eastern bagel called Ka\u2019ak with various filling options such as halloumi, cream cheese or Nutella. The aroma of the freshly baked Ka\u2019ak wafted through the place and was oh so enticing.<\/p>\n<p>After having a brief chat with Shawki regarding his inspiration to open, I placed my order. Shawki was kind enough to offer suggestions on what to order and what was most popular. I ended up ordering the Manakish with Zaatar, cheese and one with meat which was called Manakish Sfiha. I also ordered a spinach Fatayer and a Ka\u2019ak with half Nutella and banana and half halloumi.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Lebanese-Bakery-Hungry-for-Halaal1.jpeg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-7305 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Lebanese-Bakery-Hungry-for-Halaal1.jpeg\" alt=\"Lebanese Bakery Hungry for Halaal\" width=\"610\" height=\"464\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<h3>The Taste Test<\/h3>\n<p>I was blown away by the texture and taste of the hot, fresh Ka\u2019ak with the Nutella and banana. It felt like I had just tasted a little bit of heaven. Now even though it deviates from being authentic Middle Eastern, the Nutella and banana filled Ka\u2019ak is a MUST. I found the Ka\u2019ak with halloumi to be a little bit bland but acceptable especially if you like something more plain. The spinach Fatayer was not really something that jumped out at me taste wise. Personally I would not repeat it. I did however, absolutely love the Manakish selection. They looked like miniature pizzas almost. My favourite was the Sfiha or meat one. It was tasty and the meat flavour blended well with the bread base. I also really enjoyed the cheese Manakish, I found the Zaatar one to be a tad overpowering. I think with a bit of hummus the Zaatar one would have been great, but since it was topped with just the Zaatar I felt it to be too potent.<\/p>\n<p>I ordered the Laban which is a Middle Eastern yoghurt drink. It was lovely and refreshing alongside the breads. They also offer a range of coffees, juices and cooldrinks. Prices of the various bread options range from R40 to R70. For two people you would pay around R240 for a range of breads and drinks.<\/p>\n<h3>Tips<\/h3>\n<p>Parking is a problem but one can find parking at the back of the building as well as on either of the side roads. You can request half and half as the Ka\u2019ak are big. That way you can have more of a variety. The clay oven means the place gets quite warm inside, best to sit a little further away from the oven. The breads are best eaten hot so try to sit down rather than grab a takeaway.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<div><strong>By Rafieka Banderker<br \/><\/strong>Accountant by profession, writer at heart.

In fact maybe other upmarket brands would recognise this and follow suit.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/Vida-e-Hungry-for-halaal6.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-7256 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/Vida-e-Hungry-for-halaal6.jpg\" alt=\"Vida e Hungry for halaal\" width=\"610\" height=\"412\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\nIt was great to visit a Vida where I could buy something to eat and not just the coffee. Although Mohamed did insist I try their current promotional blend, the Electra. The normal house blend is the Estrella. He advised I have a Meia de Leite which is an espresso with steamed milk. I found this blend sharper and more acidic than the house blend but the more I had the better I liked it. This branch in size is somewhere between their bigger branches you would find in a mall and the small kiosk type you would find in the Shell service stations. There is one table with chairs and counter seating with bar stools available. It's more of a takeout venue at the moment but they tell me they do get people coming to have breakfast there on the weekends. Their authentic Portuguese style menu besides their well known coffee contains pastries, muffins, sandwiches, cookies and for the health conscious, yoghurt and muesli cups, juices and skinny coffee options.\r\n\r\nThe staff is friendly and vibey. Evan, in true Vida style is always quipping loudly about how I should be trying this, that or the other. I convince him to let me film him making a cappucino which he does in tandem with his star barista.\r\n\r\n[video width=\"270\" height=\"480\" m4v=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/Vida-e-vibes2.m4v\"][\/video]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI hadn't had breakfast yet so I ordered a Paozinho at R47, which is macon, mozzarella and smoked chicken on a pretzel. They toasted it for me which melted the cheese. I enjoyed the saltiness of the pretzel hugging the filling. It looks big because it's long but it's narrow so it's not overwhelming. And to drink I had something cold to offset the crazy summer heat that set in this week. How did we go 10 degrees hotter overnight in Cape Town, and for the whole week nogal?!? The mango and coconut Frio is dairy free and was the perfect refreshing choice.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/Vida-e-Hungry-for-halaal3.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-7253 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/Vida-e-Hungry-for-halaal3.jpg\" alt=\"Vida e Hungry for halaal\" width=\"610\" height=\"610\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\nI bought a quattro muffin which contains 4 types of cheeses - mozzarella, cheddar, cream cheese and feta which was my light lunch plan and a slice of carrot cake which I just could not resist...

I could have cried....\r\n\r\nSo when I found them at the V&amp;A and at lunch time no less, my stomach naturally dragged me over. I needed something that would be easy to eat on the go as I was rushing between meetings that day. I decided on the soft shell tacos. You get 2 of these with a choice of chicken, beef or vegetarian fillings with a range of additional toppings including cheese and sour cream. Only the guacamole was extra at R10. These 2 cost R55 and I thought they were great value for the price. The flavour on both were excellent and I scoffed one of them in the car one handed on the way to my next meeting. Had this been a hard shell taco I'm sure the job would have been so much more difficult.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-7243\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/Tortilla-Modern-Mexican-Hungry-for-Halaal1.jpg\" alt=\"Tortilla Modern Mexican Hungry for Halaal\" width=\"610\" height=\"724\" \/>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI really liked the visual impact of their small kiosk.

Long trips, good music and lots and lots of padkos. Last week was different and I landed up travelling to Mosselbay for business with a colleague who had the forethought to search the web for halaal accommodation in George. Completely unaware of our destination made it even more surprising when after a long drive and even longer meetings that we arrived early evening at Aziza\u2019s Guesthouse.\r\n\r\nFinding this little gem made all the difference to this trip. Waheeda the owner was on hand when we arrived and gave us quick tour of the place. The premises has been a guesthouse for some time but has only been fully halaal since she and her husband took over three months ago. The building is well kept with modern fittings and has the feel like it has been done up recently and quite tastefully so. I have spent my fair share of time in guesthouses and this one is right up there with the best.\r\n\r\nI usually travel with a little salaah compass which takes the guess work out of trying to find the direction of Qiblah. Old faithful however was not needed this time. Once we checked in, before she left, Waheeda asked me if I needed a musallah and explained that the Qiblah is marked in the rooms on the ceiling. It\u2019s a nice touch and you know you going to be well looked after from that point on.\r\n\r\nThe room I used was spacious and opened out in front of a small pool with a nice view. The bathroom was spacious, clean and the shower worked and had a decent pressure. There is nothing worse than having spent the whole day in the car and then getting to your destination and the water pressure or the shower fitting itself just doesn\u2019t cut it. There is a self-service coffee or tea tray in the room and with some variety. Hot chocolate, two types of coffee, both up market, none of that chicory nonsense and rooibos and five roses for the tea drinker. The room was spacious and the bedding and bath towels had a nice plush feel.\r\n\r\nMy colleague and I were discussing the place over breakfast, and she made a few comments with regards to some finer touches she would have liked to see in the room like earbuds and a tissue dispenser, you know the stuff only women would expect or would think to have available. The staff politely told us she would pass the message on to the owner and then proceeded to give us a little history on the place and skillfully informed us that under new ownership things are changing for the better every day. Wahida if you read this, she\u2019s a keeper. Good and loyal staff are hard to come by.\r\n\r\nBreakfast had all the usual suspects, fruit, cereal, yoghurt and of course the eggs and fried cold meats was done just how I like it. I think I have found my home away from home in George. As Arnold the \"Governator\" would say... \u201cI\u2019ll be back\u201d. Not dreading that return trip in November anymore.\r\n\r\n<strong><em>Contributed by Zulfikar Umar<\/em><\/strong>\r\n\r\n<em>Reviewed: 11 October 2018<\/em>","post_title":"Aziza Guesthouse, George","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"aziza-guesthouse-george","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2019-03-28 14:36:04","post_modified_gmt":"2019-03-28 14:36:04","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/?post_type=listing&#038;p=7209","menu_order":0,"post_type":"listing","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},{"ID":7056,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2018-09-04 15:54:23","post_date_gmt":"2018-09-04 13:54:23","post_content":"<strong>If you're working, living or visiting the CBD, you'll be glad to hear that Food Lover's Eatery, The Towers, have relaunched their halaal section.<\/strong>\n\nFood Lover's Eatery The Towers offers a huge variety of affordable modern dishes, ready-made convenience meals, and meals to order.

Mostly because of trying to find parking. It\u2019s bad enough there\u2019s so little of it to go around. And lately you practically have to take out a bond to pay for it.\n\nSo when I tried out the Food Lover\u2019s Eatery at the Towers building recently I was really chuffed, and guys, I mean really <u>chuffed<\/u> to discover you could park inside the building if you wanted to shop or eat there. Granted, it was 8 floors up, but that\u2019s better than trying find a space in the urban jungle at the bottom. This Food Lover\u2019s Eatery is like a little mall, with their fruit and vegetables and food section downstairs, a Seattle Coffee Co across the foyer, an Angelberries froyo next to that and a raw juice bar around the bend. And the main attraction, the fully halaal food section upstairs.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-7191\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/Food-Lovers-Towers-Eatery-Hungry-for-Halaal8.jpg\" alt=\"Food Lovers Towers Eatery Hungry for Halaal\" width=\"610\" height=\"682\" \/>\n\nWe popped by on a weekday around 11am and they had just started putting out the lunch buffet. The setup is canteen style but split into sections. One doing fish and chips, one fried chicken, one doing middle eastern like shawarmas and kebabs and the last a grills section doing beef and chicken burgers. Opposite these counters were a lunch buffet and salad bar where you could help yourself to whatever was on the menu for the day.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-7187\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/Food-Lovers-Towers-Eatery-Hungry-for-Halaal4.jpg\" alt=\"Food Lovers Towers Eatery Hungry for Halaal\" width=\"610\" height=\"458\" \/>\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-7186\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/Food-Lovers-Towers-Eatery-Hungry-for-Halaal3.jpg\" alt=\"Food Lovers Towers Eatery Hungry for Halaal\" width=\"610\" height=\"422\" \/>\n\nWe opted for a Steak Roll from the Grill Shack and a beef Shawarma from the middle eastern section. And then I turned around and spotted some yummy looking salads and just couldn\u2019t resist trying 2 small portions of a butternut and beetroot salad and a baby spinach and couscous salad loaded with almonds and sunflower seeds. Of course the salads were meant to offset the fries that came with both our meals, ahem\u2026\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-7190\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/Food-Lovers-Towers-Eatery-Hungry-for-Halaal7.jpg\" alt=\"Food Lovers Towers Eatery Hungry for Halaal\" width=\"610\" height=\"716\" \/>\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-7194\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/Food-Lovers-Towers-Eatery-Hungry-for-Halaal11.jpg\" alt=\"Food Lovers Towers Eatery Hungry for Halaal\" width=\"610\" height=\"701\" \/>\n\nMy steak roll was freshly prepared on the grill in front of me. An unexpectedly thick cut of beef was placed on the grill and I was asked how I would like it. Medium to well is my usual choice. I waited a few minutes while my meat was attended to and grilled just right. When the griller was happy with the doneness he painted it liberally with prego sauce and added it to a roll with some salad and a generous portion of chips. At R57.90 this was a very generous meal especially considering the size of the steak. We collected the shawarma after choosing the various fillings to go with it. It was also a large portion with chips at R48. We popped our goodies in a basket and took it downstairs to pay.\n\nOf course we would have had to walk past the confectionary counter at the bottom of the escalator. I\u2019m certainly not known for my heroic resistance, so as you can imagine, our basket got just a little bit fuller. The bakery section downstairs also had a halaal certificate on the wall. I picked out some giant cookies, a fancy hedgehog cupcake for my kiddo, a lemon tart and pecan nut pastry for later. There is also a sushi bar downstairs. After enquiring I was told that the vinegar used in the preparation of the sushi rice contains alcohol. So you may want to avoid the sushi bar.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-7185\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/Food-Lovers-Towers-Eatery-Hungry-for-Halaal2.jpg\" alt=\"Food Lovers Towers Eatery Hungry for Halaal\" width=\"610\" height=\"425\" \/>\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-7195\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/Food-Lovers-Towers-Eatery-Hungry-for-Halaal12.jpg\" alt=\"Food Lovers Towers Eatery Hungry for Halaal\" width=\"610\" height=\"610\" \/>\n\nWe went to the counter to pay for our bounty. It\u2019s also the only place you can weigh what you have chosen. The downside to this is that you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re going to pay until you\u2019re at the teller. The food prices are reasonable though and definitely cheaper than restaurant prices.\n\nThe seating available is outside the building. Modern wood and steel tables and stools with lots of greenery and a great city view. It was cold though so we opted to eat inside at the tables by the juice bar. We got some coffees from Seattle and tucked in. Zulfi thoroughly enjoyed his shawarma, it was full and tasty. My burger was way too much for me and I took half home. I felt the steak could have marinated in the sauce rather than just being added on after. It would have given the meat a bit more punch. The chips were crunchy and well seasoned.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-7189\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/Food-Lovers-Towers-Eatery-Hungry-for-Halaal6.jpg\" alt=\"Food Lovers Towers Eatery Hungry for Halaal\" width=\"610\" height=\"813\" \/>\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-7184\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/Food-Lovers-Towers-Eatery-Hungry-for-Halaal1.jpg\" alt=\"Food Lovers Towers Eatery Hungry for Halaal\" width=\"610\" height=\"458\" \/>\n\nThe offering here is convenience food. It\u2019s casual and quick and great for a break away from the office or if you\u2019re in the CBD and need to catch a quick bite. What I like is that you can also buy portions from the buffet to take home and serve for supper. I spotted Chicken Stir Fry, lamb Curry and even Akhni. Great options for those nights when you\u2019re working late and still need to feed the family.\n\nFind them on the foreshore Monday to Friday from 7am to 6pm and and Saturday 9am to 6pm.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-7192\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/Food-Lovers-Towers-Eatery-Hungry-for-Halaal9.jpg\" alt=\"Food Lovers Towers Eatery Hungry for Halaal\" width=\"610\" height=\"482\" \/>\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-7193\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/Food-Lovers-Towers-Eatery-Hungry-for-Halaal10.jpg\" alt=\"Food Lovers Towers Eatery Hungry for Halaal\" width=\"610\" height=\"458\" \/>\n\n<em>Reviewed: 3 October 2018\nThis is a sponsored review.

Plus, it\u2019s not often we get authentic fully halaal Middle Eastern cuisine in Cape Town. Now, the reason I am not lumping this under the Mediterranean Cuisine banner is that though similar, the culinary traditions of the Middle East embody tastes and textures different from North African and European Mediterranean Cuisine.\n\nI contacted Majd Mohamed who assists her mother, Intesar Mohamed and expressed my interest in writing a piece on their offerings. She suggested they demonstrate the process and how everything is made. And thus an amazing Saturday afternoon of Middle Eastern culinary delight was borne.\n<h3><strong>How it began<\/strong><\/h3>\nOver chatter and Arabian coffee before the meal I got the story of how The Falafel Shop began. Intesar and her family relocated from Jordan to Cape Town 23 years ago. Majd was just two at the time. Having no family or acquaintances here, they began making friends in their area as well as at their school where their father also taught. They often had friends over for a meal. A scrumptious Middle Eastern meal was laid out each time. Their friends suggested to Intesar that she start a home-based business, so they could purchase her goodies guilt-free. Intesar is an incredibly inspirational and selfless woman and she refused to accept money in exchange for any cooking requests initially. Finally The Falafel Shop sprung to life on the 1<sup>st<\/sup> August this year.\n\nWhile chatting about the challenges of their relocation, what came out strongly was both Majd and Intesar\u2019s love for their homeland and culture. And of course the Jordanian food. I watched as Intesar expertly moulded and fried falafel and brinjal chips. Simultaneously Majd was hustling away, brewing mint tea, cutting up veggies to dip with hummus and toasting pita bread. Majd suggests you warm the pita bread in the toaster as it helps to puff up nicely. They sell the pitas as part of their offerings too, although Intesar does not have the capacity to prepare it herself at present. She does intend to expand her selection in the near future to include labneh and babaganoush.\n\n<video controls=\"controls\" width=\"271\" height=\"480\"><source src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Falafel-Shop-Hungry-for-Halaal8.m4v\" \/><\/video>\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-7035\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Falafel-Shop-Hungry-for-Halaal1.jpeg\" alt=\"Falafel-Shop-Hungry-for-Halaal\" width=\"621\" height=\"674\" \/>\n<h3><strong>The taste test<\/strong><\/h3>\nOnce the spread was prepared, we all sat around the table to enjoy a taste of Jordan. The falafel was some of the best I\u2019ve tasted and had me reminiscing of the ones I had in Saudi and on the streets of London. Intesar tells me that she doesn\u2019t believe in freezing anything and thus everything is made daily from scratch. This comes through in the taste of the falafel and hummus. The falafel was perfectly crunchy on the outside and had a beautiful nutty flavour. The hummus was wholesome and tasty. It was also fresh and full, one can tell nothing has been skimped on. In fact, it has survived in my fridge for almost a whole week.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-7038\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Falafel-Shop-Hungry-for-Halaal4.jpeg\" alt=\"Falafel-Shop-Hungry-for-Halaal\" width=\"617\" height=\"457\" \/>\n\nIntesar goes on to demonstrate how they prepare the pita breads with the filling. She rubs the inside of the pita bread with hummus and then added the falafel, suggesting you should flatten the falafel in the pita. The brinjal chips were added next. One could also add the plain mince which is a popular item in Jordan. However, my sole focus was on the yummy falafel so I stuck to that as the main filling. We then had a choice of adding a mixed salad of finely chopped tomato, cucumber and peppers or tzatziki (which in Jordan is called Laban). Last, but not least we added shatta, which was the piece de resistance. I couldn\u2019t believe a tiny tub of chillies could take the experience to a whole new level. Majd says it is not well known in Cape Town but they absolutely have to have it with their meals. She tells me one can call it a chilli sauce of sorts. At R10 a pop, I strongly recommend that you don\u2019t leave without this little tub of goodness.\n\n<video controls=\"controls\" width=\"271\" height=\"480\"><source src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Falafel-Shop-Hungry-for-Halaal9.m4v\" \/><\/video>\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-7039\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Falafel-Shop-Hungry-for-Halaal5.jpeg\" alt=\"Falafel-Shop-Hungry-for-Halaal\" width=\"626\" height=\"842\" \/>\n\nTo round off we were treated to soothing mint tea with tasty Middle Eastern biscuits called ma\u2019mool, filled with either nuts or dates. The ma'mool were melt in your mouth and so flavourful. I do hope she adds these to her menu soon. I had a truly memorable afternoon of learning and tasting. What I do know is that I will most definitely be back for more. Putting together a home-made Middle Eastern meal has never been this easy. What\u2019s going through my mind is, when is the next birthday or event so I can incorporate all this and give my guests the same delightful taste of the Middle East I had.\n<h3><strong>But what does it cost?<\/strong><\/h3>\nThe Falafel mixture, hummus, shatta and pita breads are available on order at least 24 hours in advance.

Klipfontein road being the essence of a busy Bombay street anytime of the day. So it\u2019s no surprise that you\u2019ll find no less than three Indo-Pak cuisine inspired restaurants in this scant 40 square km neighbourhood. Two of them are from the Bismillah group and the menus are very similar. More recently, with the opening of the new Rylands Village shopping centre, a third restaurant called Gulshan has opened.\r\n\r\nNow you\u2019d ask, how much can you re-invent an Indian menu? And I\u2019d have to agree that unless you can find a new spin on the offering, this can be rather challenging. Gulshan seems to have a slightly more polished act than the other two. I daresay, just slightly. The restaurant feels a bit brighter, and the booth seating a bit more inviting. While it feels a bit fresher the use of maroon and gold in the d\u00e9cor still brings home the traditional feel.\r\n\r\nOn the menu are all the usual suspects. A vast array of Indian Kormas and Curries, Tandoories and Grills, Manchurian Sizzlers and Asian noodle dishes. They did have a point of difference though. Something I have yet to see at any of the other menus. Sheeps Brains Curry! Not for the faint hearted! It is definitely an acquired taste. I personally am not a fan of eating sheeps brains, I always found it too much like way too soft scrambled eggs. This is a first time I've had it as a curry. It's actually not bad this way but I wouldn't order it. My husband on the other hand absolutely loved it. He grew up eating sheeps brains and this was rekindling memories for him. It's quite hot and spicy and the naans went very well with it. Give it a go if you have a sense of adventure. Else, stick to the suspects previously mentioned. If you like Indian veggies I also spotted Bhindi (Lady Finger) Masala, and Karela with Potato.\r\n\r\nThe Mansooriyan Chicken I had was hot, spicy and a bit sweet. I quite enjoyed it. We had ordered crumbed chicken nuggets and chips for Taufeeq from the kids menu. These were dry and tasted like they came out of a box and I sent them back. They were replaced without a hassle. We also ordered a cheese and aloo paratha, which was quite spicy. It\u2019s also very filling and could make a light meal on it\u2019s own, which at R30 would make a cheap lunch. Most of the curries average R70 to R80, with the Brains Masala at R110.\r\n\r\nThe general atmosphere is casual. Service is of the typical Indo-Pak variety with young male pakistani waiters tending to your needs. They have an adjoining section which can be used for small functions and also serves as a salaah area.","post_title":"Gulshan, Rylands","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"gulshan-rylands","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2022-01-26 22:47:10","post_modified_gmt":"2022-01-26 20:47:10","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/?post_type=listing&#038;p=7025","menu_order":0,"post_type":"listing","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"1","filter":"raw"},{"ID":6269,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2018-07-31 10:52:58","post_date_gmt":"2018-07-31 10:52:58","post_content":"<strong>Update: <\/strong>The Daily Coffee Caf\u00e9 has changed it's name to Gordon\u2019s Bay Coffee Caf\u00e9. It still has the same owners. The menu and vibe remains exactly the same.\n\n<strong>HOUSE REVIEW<\/strong>\n\nI have fielded a great many frustrated enquiries from people in the helderberg area looking for halaal places to eat. The Strand, Gordons Bay area, while a hugely popular holiday and summer time destination is not known for catering well to halaal food seekers. I\u2019ve always felt bad telling people \u201csorry, I don\u2019t know of any places in the vicinity\u201d, until now. I had heard that a halaal coffee shop had opened in Gordons Bay. So when a beautiful 30 degrees Sunday beckoned us to the beach we decided to make a day of it and head to the new GB Mall for breakfast before enjoying the water.\n\nMall is really and overstatement for the quaint little shopping centre situated on Sir Lowry\u2019s Pass road. Anchored by Checkers it comprises of no more than 10 or so stores built around a central open courtyard. The mall is true to the unhurried small town charm of Gordons Bay while still feeling modern and furnished with all necessary amenities. The Daily Coffee opens onto the courtyard and we decided to enjoy the warm summer morning at the outside tables.\n\nThe caf\u00e9 is part of a franchise group comprising 23 stores around South Africa. The Gordons Bay store is the first halaal branch in the group. They describe their d\u00e9cor as New York meets The Karoo. The style is evident in the mix of urban coffee shop styling with rustic wood accents and copper lampshades. The cactus table centres and what I assume were kudu horns on the shelves certainly brought the concept to life.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-6278\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/The-Daily-Coffee-Cafe-Hungry-for-halaal9.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"610\" height=\"458\" \/>\n\nWe were offered menus by the friendly waitress who had seated us. She also engaged with my little one trying to elicit what he would like for breakfast. As he had already eaten we gave in to him having a bubblegum milkshake instead. We opted for the the Daily Fix breakfast for him, comprising of 2 eggs, 2 spicy dhanya sausages, grilled macon, grilled tomato, saut\u00e9ed mushrooms, fries and toast of your choice for R86. My choice was the Open Croque with bolognaise sauce which was an open toastie topped with bolognaise mince, a fried egg and cheese sauce for R78. The Daily Fix was quite substantial and I liked the flavor of the dhanya sausage. Too often I am disappointed with the flavourless sausage normally served with breakfast dishes. This one had good flavor though it could have been cooked just a little more. The Open Croque despite not looking it at first proved to be quite a filling meal. The bolognaise was tasty but my Indian palate missed a touch more spiciness. I was offered a very hot peri peri sauce from local producers Quality Foods which did the trick. The one thing I would change though was to choose my bread base as ciabatta. I had opted for rye but the flavours of the dish completely overpowered the rye bread, which made it a waste.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-6280\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/The-Daily-Coffee-Cafe-Hungry-for-halaal11.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"610\" height=\"813\" \/>\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-6279\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/The-Daily-Coffee-Cafe-Hungry-for-halaal10.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"610\" height=\"499\" \/>\n\nHad I been at a more formal restaurant I would expect that a good waiter would have pointed that out, but this was after all a casual coffee shop and a waiter was unlikely to interfere with a customers preferences in bread.\n\nOne of the owners of the shop came to check on us and we got to chatting. Fatima Ravat and Melissa Hope own the shop together. They are both from corporate backgrounds in Johannesburg and have relocated to Cape Town to make a go of it in the restaurant business. Fatima is the number cruncher in the business but was also very present in front of house, while Melissa is the foodie and runs the show in the kitchen.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-6277\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/The-Daily-Coffee-Cafe-Hungry-for-halaal8.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"610\" height=\"813\" \/>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Fatima Ravat who I managed to snap and Melissa Hope are the owners of the Gordons Bay store<\/em><\/p>\nWe ended our breakfast with the house cappuccino which Melissa explained uses the Daily\u2019s own house blend, a mix of carefully roasted Ugandan and Ethiopian beans. Coffee is served on a branded wooden tasting board along with a cute little biscuit. I found the coffee on the milder side but the flavor was really good and I was glad to add another good coffee option to my list. I also spotted a shelf where you could buy their ground coffee or pods to enjoy at home.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-6281\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/The-Daily-Coffee-Cafe-Hungry-for-halaal12.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"610\" height=\"813\" \/>\n\nPrices are very much on par with other mainstream mall located coffee shops. Service was friendly and the atmosphere was relaxed and unhurried. I would definitely swing by again when I\u2019m in the area.\n\n<em>Listed: 21 February 2018<\/em>","post_title":"Gordon\u2019s Bay Coffee Caf\u00e9, Gordons Bay","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"the-daily-coffee-cafe","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2020-09-30 16:00:12","post_modified_gmt":"2020-09-30 16:00:12","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/?post_type=listing&#038;p=6269","menu_order":0,"post_type":"listing","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},{"ID":6510,"post_author":"694","post_date":"2018-05-29 21:59:26","post_date_gmt":"2018-05-29 19:59:26","post_content":"Let\u2019s eat cake\r\n\r\nCatering\u00a0\u00a0for all your special occasions\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-family: '.SFUIText-Semibold'; font-size: 14pt;\"><strong><em>Gourmet cupcakes R180 for a box of 20 4 flavors of choice\u00a0<\/em><\/strong><\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-family: '.SFUIText-Semibold'; font-size: 14pt;\"><strong><em>Carrot , red velvet , lemon meringue, Vanilla custard, chocolate , salted caramel , vanilla cream cheese, strawberry , sweetypie\u00a0<\/em><\/strong><\/span>\r\n\r\n<strong><em>\u00a0<\/em><\/strong>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-family: '.SFUIText-Semibold'; font-size: 14pt;\"><strong><em>Mini cakes (minimum of 10 each)<\/em><\/strong><\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-family: '.SFUIText-Semibold'; font-size: 14pt;\"><strong><em>Choc ganache R10<\/em><\/strong><\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-family: '.SFUIText-Semibold'; font-size: 14pt;\"><strong><em>Vanilla caramel cream R10<\/em><\/strong><\/span>\r\n\r\n<strong><em>\u00a0<\/em><\/strong>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-family: '.SFUIText-Semibold'; font-size: 14pt;\"><strong><em>Eclairs R6<\/em><\/strong><\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-family: '.SFUIText-Semibold'; font-size: 14pt;\"><strong><em>Pavlovas (seasonal fruit) R10<\/em><\/strong><\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-family: '.SFUIText-Semibold'; font-size: 14pt;\"><strong><em>Cream Snowballs R5,50<\/em><\/strong><\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-family: '.SFUIText-Semibold'; font-size: 14pt;\"><strong><em>Cream puffs R6<\/em><\/strong><\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-family: '.SFUIText-Semibold'; font-size: 14pt;\"><strong><em>Fancies R5<\/em><\/strong><\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-family: '.SFUIText-Semibold'; font-size: 14pt;\"><strong><em>Tarts R7<\/em><\/strong><\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-family: '.SFUIText-Semibold'; font-size: 14pt;\"><strong><em>Choc mousse, peppermint, milk tart, cheesecake, lemon meringue<\/em><\/strong><\/span>\r\n\r\n<strong><em>\u00a0<\/em><\/strong>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-family: '.SFUIText-Semibold'; font-size: 14pt;\"><strong><em>Mini Desserts (minimum of 12) R16<\/em><\/strong><\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-family: '.SFUIText-Semibold'; font-size: 14pt;\"><strong><em>Oreo mousse\u00a0<\/em><\/strong><\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-family: '.SFUIText-Semibold'; font-size: 14pt;\"><strong><em>Choc mousse<\/em><\/strong><\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-family: '.SFUIText-Semibold'; font-size: 14pt;\"><strong><em>Peppermint<\/em><\/strong><\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-family: '.SFUIText-Semibold'; font-size: 14pt;\"><strong><em>Cheesecake (asstd flavors)<\/em><\/strong><\/span>\r\n\r\n<strong><em>\u00a0<\/em><\/strong>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-family: '.SFUIText-Semibold'; font-size: 14pt;\"><strong><em>Choc ganache Bundt R220<\/em><\/strong><\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-family: '.SFUIText-Semibold'; font-size: 14pt;\"><strong><em>Red velvet R250<\/em><\/strong><\/span>\r\n<h1><span style=\"font-family: '.SFUIText-Semibold'; font-size: 14pt;\"><strong><em>Carrot\u00a0<\/em><\/strong> R300<\/span><\/h1>\r\n<span style=\"font-family: '.SFUIText-Semibold'; font-size: 14pt;\"><strong><em>Cheesecake (ass flavors) R280<\/em><\/strong><\/span>\r\n\r\nplatters available\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>Listed: May 2018<\/em>","post_title":"Let\u2019s eat cake, Ottery","post_excerpt":"Cakes and desserts","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"lets-eat-cake","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2019-03-28 09:26:27","post_modified_gmt":"2019-03-28 09:26:27","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/?post_type=listing&#038;p=6510","menu_order":0,"post_type":"listing","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},{"ID":6492,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2018-05-03 00:41:30","post_date_gmt":"2018-05-02 22:41:30","post_content":"<span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">HOUSE REVIEW<\/span>\n\nLet\u2019s be honest, everyone entering Canal Walk through entrance 3 Lower Level would have been enticed by the delicious aromas wafting towards them from the Col'cacchio kitchen. Alas, we as Muslims could not drop in for a quick bite as Col'cacchio was not halaal, until now that is! This iconic brand has finally seen the light and have gone fully halaal with 3 of their stores, one in Cape Town at Canal Walk, one in Athol in Johannesburg, and another soon in Durban.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-6498\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Colcacchio-Hungry-for-Halaal6.jpg\" alt=\"Colcacchio Hungry for Halaal\" width=\"610\" height=\"704\" \/>\n\nOn Wednesday last week, we were invited to the official media launch of Col'cacchio, Canal Walk. After being seated and amidst introductions and reconnecting with other influencers, I was offered a drink. While waiting I took in the d\u00e9cor which is simple and elegant with neutral colours. The dark wood particularly stands out with the 3 curved booths at the back.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-6493\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Colcacchio-Hungry-for-Halaal1.jpg\" alt=\"Colcacchio Hungry for Halaal\" width=\"610\" height=\"813\" \/>\n\nColcacchio now offers a great range of mocktails: so it goes without saying that I ordered one, being a huge fan of these exotic and colourful drinks. My pick of the day was the Kiwi Daiquiri. Having tried countless daiquiris, this one was a true refreshing delight. I have never come across a Kiwi Daquiri before, mix it with mint and you have a winner. It was neither too frosty nor overpoweringly sweet. Later on I tasted some of the Berry Daquiri, which was also great, particularly the cherry flavour that came through. One huge brownie point to Colcacchio was that they were using bamboo straws!\n\nNow on to the food. First up was the tagliata: sliced sirloin steak with a homemade sundried tomato, garlic, chilli and olive oil tagliata sauce. The steak was cooked medium, which allowed the tastiness of the meat to filter through. The sauce added wonderful flavour, although my palate did not register any chilli (this palate is too accustomed to the hotter side of the food spectrum).\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-6495\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Colcacchio-Hungry-for-Halaal3.jpg\" alt=\"Colcacchio Hungry for Halaal\" width=\"610\" height=\"692\" \/>\n\nPasta lovers you have got to try the Blu Formaggi pasta. It is Italian-style blue cheese sauce, chicken macon, garlic pangrattato and crispy onion. Not being much of a pasta fan, I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this simple yet creamy and flavoursome dish. In case you think the blue cheese sauce may be a turn off- let me assure you I didn\u2019t even realise it was blue cheese sauce until I saw the menu. The flavour of the blue cheese is ever so slight but adds to the creaminess beautifully. The chicken macon was a hit, I have never tasted macon so well cooked. It was anything but dry and fatty.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-6494\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Colcacchio-Hungry-for-Halaal2.jpg\" alt=\"Colcacchio Hungry for Halaal\" width=\"610\" height=\"735\" \/>\n\nOkay so we all know Colcacchio as \u2018the pizza place\u2019, and rightly so. Their pizzas are thin-based, gourmet-style, non-greasy and they offer a huge variety of unique topping combinations. Not only that, they offer half and half pizzas. Bottom line, their pizzas were some of the best I have tried thus far. We certainly lack this kind of offering on the halaal restaurant scene.\n\nWe tried 3 pizzas: Morituri, The Moghul and Norm\u2019s Pralina. First up the Morituri, which had seasoned chicken, avo, macon, feta and roasted red pepper. It was tasty and the topping was plentiful. The topping combination was pretty standard I thought. So if you prefer a no-fuss pizza this one is for you.\n\nThe Norm\u2019s Pralina had a butternut and tomato base and the topping was roasted butternut, chilli, feta, pumpkin seed praline and rocket. I have never tasted such a unique combination on a pizza, that this truly took my breath away. Pure yumminess! The pumpkin seed praline is what truly gave it that blast of flavour. Inge, the owner and our host informed me that it is their most popular vegetarian pizza, I can definitely vouch for why.\n\nThe last one was The Moghul, if you like Indian cuisine this one is right up your alley. I never thought butter chicken on a pizza would work, surprisingly this one did the trick. Topped with butter chicken, yoghurt, galbani fior di latte mozzarella, coriander and crispy onion, this one definitely catered to my palette. It was tasty with the added freshness of the coriander that cuts\n\nthrough. Although I do think I would prefer it without the crispy onions.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-6499\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Colcacchio-Hungry-for-Halaal7.jpg\" alt=\"Colcacchio Hungry for Halaal\" width=\"610\" height=\"813\" \/>\n\nAll you dessert lovers, here it comes - dessert was chocolate brownies and profiteroles. The brownie was the perfect combination of chewy, moist, decadent and had the added delight of hazelnuts. The profiteroles were covered in white chocolate and one bite meant a melt-in-your-mouth moment. Decadence oozed out in the form of cream, slight coffee flavours, chocolate and pastry.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-6501\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Colcacchio-Hungry-for-Halaal9.jpg\" alt=\"Colcacchio Hungry for Halaal\" width=\"610\" height=\"813\" \/>\n\nWhat stood out? The great range of unique pizzas, there literally is something for everyone. The service is top-notch. Don\u2019t forget to take the little ones along, they have a bambino menu as well. I absolutely loved the new range of mocktails. Who knew little profiteroles could be so delightful. Enough to get me to frequent Colcacchio\u2019s just for dessert and coffee.\n\nWhat could be improved on? I thought the price was a tad steep, although one has to factor in the quality of the food, the service and the fact that it is a sit down restaurant. Their dishes could have more of a kick, depending on your palate some dishes may come across as bland. I noticed others adding chilli and garlic to the pizzas too.\n\nFor those concerned about how the kitchen was handled after the change to halaal, rest assured. I spoke to Inge, the owner, who confirmed that all wooden and plastic utensils were discarded. All stainless steel and other equipment were sanitized by MJC as per their processes.\n\nThe menu has remained the same overall, of course all unhalaal meat has been replaced with its halaal counterpart.\n<div>\u00a0<strong>By Rafieka Banderker\n<\/strong>Accountant by profession, writer at heart.

Since inception in 1987 they had both a restaurant and separate takeaway store adjacent to the restaurant.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-6463\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/Bibis-Kitchen-Hungry-for-Halaal3.jpeg\" alt=\"Bibis Kitchen Hungry for Halaal\" width=\"610\" height=\"407\" \/>\n\nBibis celebrated their 30<sup>th<\/sup> birthday anniversary in 2017 and with good reason do they have that staying power. They have moved to adjust to the change in customer preference and their quality is unparalleled. Since closing the restaurant in 2007, their focus has been on their revamped takeaway store that caters to sit downs as well. The store decor is simple yet trendy with orange and white chairs and wall mosaics.\n\nThere is ample parking right outside and they also offer home delivery through Mr Delivery. There is seating available if you prefer to eat there, however it could possibly accommodate around 30-35 people at one seating. Large groups may want to call in advance. The one aspect that needs improvement is the provision for a restroom in store for customers to use. As it is mainly a takeaway the need might not have arisen for a public restroom, however since the revamp there is a need for it as some people prefer to sit down. They do provide a wash basin to wash your hands after your meal.\n\nBibis mostly offers North Indian cuisine. They have a wide range of chicken, lamb, seafood and vegetarian dishes. They also offer basic takeaway meals for those who prefer a regular burger, sandwich or hotdog. For those who like a starter, there is a savoury counter where you can buy some hot samosas or pies to munch on while you wait for you meal.\n\nNot only that, if you have a sweet tooth and want to round off your meal, they have a great range of dessert such as pistachio kulfi, mango cheesecake, rasmalai, trifle and even falooda or a mango lassi. Apart from the dessert counter, they also have a cake counter with delightful mini cakes, koeksisters and cupcakes. For anyone who needs pre-packed biscuits to save yourself the baking effort, you can buy those at the cake counter too. This adds to the value that Bibis provides in terms of convenience foods, cakes, biscuits and savouries. Let\u2019s face it sometimes we just don\u2019t have time to cook or bake.\n\nHaving tasted their butter chicken, prawn chaat, lamb breyani, prawn moghlai, grilled kingklip, grilled prawns, tandoori fillet and masala steak sandwich: I can attest to the fact that every dish is as appetizing and tasty as it looks. I personally prefer the Indian dishes as it is as authentic as one can get in Cape Town, especially since I have a preference for North Indian cuisine. The Indian dishes are prepared by a chef from India.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-6461\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/Bibis-Kitchen-Hungry-for-Halaal1.jpeg\" alt=\"Bibis Kitchen Hungry for Halaal\" width=\"610\" height=\"915\" \/>\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-6464\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/Bibis-Kitchen-Hungry-for-Halaal4.jpeg\" alt=\"Bibis Kitchen Hungry for Halaal\" width=\"610\" height=\"915\" \/>\n\nI must admit their masala steak sandwich did hit the spot too, although I found it a bit steep in price. The price range is above average, although one does not mind due to the consistent quality. The curries and breyanis are value for money in that it feeds at least 2 people. I could not finish any meal on my own apart from the masala steak sandwich (I visited on two or three different occasions). I loved their vegetable and mince samoosas. It was really some of the best I have tasted. On that, did I mention they sell frozen savouries? If you ever run late and can\u2019t make something to take to an event, Bibis can help you out.\n\nTheir signature dish is the prawn chaat, trust me you do not want to leave Bibis without trying it. It was most definitely my favourite. It was fresh, warm, creamy, tasty and the chilli was perfect to suit any palette. The prawns in the prawn chaat were large and the puris it was served with were soft and flaky. None of their curries are too spicy, it caters to a wide audience. However, you can request your meal to be more spicy if you like. You have a choice of rice, naan or chapatti that comes standard with any curry.\n\nThe mango lassi is refreshing, I felt the consistency may have been a tad too thick. However that did not take away from the delicious taste.\n\nIf you enjoy ice-cream, you must try the pistachio kulfi. It took me back to India. It was the perfect mix of cardamom, pistachio, creamy and sweet.\n\nLastly, their koeksisters are quite literally off the hook! They are award-winning (yes, KFM best koeksister competition).\n\nOverall a very pleasant food experience, with top quality food. Definitely some of the most authentic and tasty Indian dishes that Cape Town has to offer.\n<div>\u00a0<strong>By Rafieka Banderker\n<\/strong>Accountant by profession, writer at heart.

But when that foodie is Indian to begin with and does not favour the infamous bunny chow then you may have a bit of a stalemate. But not to worry, Durban is not merely a clich\u00e9 of bunny chow and curry, we discovered a delightful variety of cuisines on our trip there last month.\n\nAs we were staying in Umhlanga, we headed for Gateway Shopping Centre to stock up on some essentials for our self catering accommodation. Adega Restaurant at Gateway is halaal so we decided to have lunch there. They are known for seafood and Portuguese style cuisine. The restaurant at Gateway was fairly busy at lunch time. Set on an open court outside the mall their were also tables outside for thise wanting to enjoy the sunny Durban weather. We were seated inside efficiently, choosing to enjoy the aircon instead. Menus were brought and drinks orders were taken. I took in the feel of the place. It was bright and airy, with a sophisticated feel in spite of the plastic textured tablecloths overlaying the fabric ones underneath, rather like an upmarket Ocean Basket. There was Mediterranean touches in the d\u00e9cor and trendy cladding on the walls. Stairs led upstairs to which we were told was a Salaah area.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-6323\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/Adega-Gateway-Hungry-for-Halaal1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"610\" height=\"763\">\n\nThe menu was quite large with an array of starters that included in true Portuguese style Trinchado, Rissoles and Stuffed Calamari. We were pretty hungry and decided to forego the starters and head straight for mains. The bread basket which was offered sufficed. I was surprised though that it was served with margarine and not butter. Our platter for 2 consisted of chicken, prawns and grilled calamari served in their signature sauce with rice and chips. We wanted to try the hot version of the sauce but our waiter on learning we were not locals advised us to have the hot sauce on the side. A very good decision indeed we would learn in due course. It was served in a chaffing dish which was great because the food stayed hot and it added a little drama to the presentation. It did dominate the entire 4 seater table though. Had we been 4 adults instead of 2 and a quarter, it would have been very crowded. I finally got what all the fuss is about though. The signature flavor is delicious. The chicken and prawns were coated in this creamy, spicy, lemony sauce that you just wanted to sop up with everything. I was even pouring it over my rice and sucking at prawn shells with no shame. Not a drop was to be wasted, especially at R430 for this combo.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-6324\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/Adega-Gateway-Hungry-for-Halaal2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"610\" height=\"813\">\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-6325\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/Adega-Gateway-Hungry-for-Halaal3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"610\" height=\"624\">\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-6327\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/Adega-Gateway-Hungry-for-Halaal5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"610\" height=\"813\">\n\nTaufeeq\u2019s chicken pasta at R65 from the kiddies menu was also quite tasty and as expected too large a portion. The pasta was creamy and had their signature Portuguese flavor. I did feel the chicken in this dish was a skimpy though. He did not finish it but at least he had another meal from the leftovers.\n\nWhat\u2019s nice about their menu is their large variety. The Portuguese style adding a medley of different flavours to choose from like the Prawn Na\u00e7ional - Pan-fried in bay leaves, garlic, cream and Portuguese spices served with white rice; or Grilled Cod Fish - A generous portion of cod fish topped with green peppers, garlic, olive oil, sliced raw onions, boiled potatoes and a sprinkle of olives. They are pretty expensive though, with platters on average at R300 to R600. Starters range from R59 to R106 and a good choice of desserts at about R50 each. Also note that they include a 10% service charge on all bills.\n\nIt\u2019s not a place I\u2019d choose to go with small kids even though it\u2019s got a kiddies menu and it\u2019s not somewhere you go to get great value for money, but I can tell you this\u2026.. those prawns are really worth splurging on.\n\n<em>Reviewed 14 March 2018<\/em>","post_title":"Adega, Gateway","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"adega-gateway","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2022-01-26 23:43:45","post_modified_gmt":"2022-01-26 21:43:45","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/?post_type=listing&#038;p=6316","menu_order":0,"post_type":"listing","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"1","filter":"raw"},{"ID":6012,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2017-12-01 08:37:17","post_date_gmt":"2017-12-01 08:37:17","post_content":"&nbsp;\n\nThe Street Food concept has been doing the rounds for some years and has been growing in popularity. In Cape Town, most of it has been in the form of home based vendors who only serve on specific days, creating cult followings who wait loyally for their weekly fix. Some major franchises like Rocomamas have cottoned on to this trend and created sit down eateries where you can enjoy the messy hands concept in a restaurant environment. A halaal option in Cape Town has been elusive though. Besides Woodies at the V&amp;A who pioneered this trend.\n\nAlong comes Brocka, with their slick urban streetstyle look and feel designed by the acclaimed Industrial designer Aiden Bennetts, their exciting on trend menu and an everyday accessibility for breakfast, lunch and supper in a sit down venue in the centrally located Canal Walk Mall.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-6013\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/Brocka-bannerT-Hungry-for-Halaal.jpg\" alt=\"Brocka bannerT Hungry for Halaal\" width=\"1024\" height=\"740\">\n\nTheir unique venue is unmissable at the Pick n Pay entrance of the mall. The container in a warehouse concept with the name in huge billboard lights above it make for an eye-catching entrance. The interior is atmospheric, with a unique blend of rustic and ultra-modern finishes. An indoor laser cut pergola, copper-hued Tolix chairs, exposed brickwork, and homespun table elements, contribute to an urban decay feel.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-6058\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/Brocka-Hungry-for-Halaal2.jpg\" alt=\"Brocka Hungry for Halaal\" width=\"610\" height=\"813\">\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe concept is not that of a full restaurant. You order you meal at the counter and take a seat if you\u2019re eating in. Your food will be brought to your table in rustic Brockafied wooden trays. Burgers are wrapped in branded paper and ribs, wings and fries are served in disposable cardboard containers. Cutlery is also of the disposable wooden variety. It almost feels a bit like a roadhouse concept. There are no waiters taking orders, just servers who will bring you your order.\n\nThe menu is cheeky, and includes \u201cMoerse Shakes\u201d, \u201cBig Buns\u201d, \u201cLit Ribs\u201d and more. It is definitely on fleek! At the media launch last Thursday we got to sample some of the goodies. So on to the important stuff, the food:\n\nWe started with the ribs which was sweet and sticky as expected, tender and falling off the bone. The wings were ok, good flavor but not pre-fried or sticky enough for me. I felt like they needed more texture.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-6065\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/Brocka-Hungry-for-Halaal9.jpg\" alt=\"Brocka Hungry for Halaal\" width=\"610\" height=\"813\">\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThen came the Veteran burger which is their basic burger that comes with a hand pressed Beef patty and BBQ sauce. All burgers are served with mayo, lettuce, onion, tomato and pickles on a brioche bun. I like the brioche bun because it adds an extra level of flavor to the burger. I found this burger tasty but too messy for me. Next time I won\u2019t unwrap it completely. It might be easier to eat if you unwrap as you go along.\n\nThe Mexican Fest burger was flavour packed with the addition of 3 chilli poppers, chilli sauce and avo. The chilli poppers on the burger were an innovative touch. Loved it. These came with rustic hand cut fries which were also very good.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-6057\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/Brocka-Hungry-for-Halaal1.jpg\" alt=\"Brocka Hungry for Halaal\" width=\"612\" height=\"722\">\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Image credit: Tabassum Aleem<\/em><\/p>\n&nbsp;\n\nOf the sweet dishes on offer there was the Rocky Road waffle with chocolate, marshmallow, caramel and nuts which was good as well as the Usual Suspect with maple syrup, banana and nuts both served with cream. These came with a popcorn milkshake known as the \u201cGold Digger\u201d. While I usually find caramel flavoured anything too sweet for me, I found this milkshake to be just right. The popcorn added crunch and the flake was an old school but welcome chocolatey touch.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-6067\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/Brocka-Hungry-for-Halaal11.jpg\" alt=\"Brocka Hungry for Halaal\" width=\"610\" height=\"813\">\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-6068\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/Brocka-Hungry-for-Halaal12.jpg\" alt=\"Brocka Hungry for Halaal\" width=\"611\" height=\"704\">\n\nPrices are a bit on the higher end of the scale and ranges from R59 for the Veteran burger only to R79 for a combo with fries and soda. The Mexican came in at R89 for the burger only. Ribs at R99 for 400g (no fries), and wings at R69 for 400g. Waffles start at R49, shakes from R39 to R59. Kids could be accomodated by the Munchies section on the menu that has smaller burgers, loaded fries and a quesadilla.\n\nThey have some vegetarian options on the menu, but make no mistake, Brocka is aimed at meat eaters. Breakfast options are available as well as a small coffee menu. There\u2019s still lots to try on this menu and I\u2019m going back real soon for them cheesy loaded fries\u2026..","post_title":"Brocka, Canal Walk","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"brocka-canal-walk","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2024-08-22 20:38:38","post_modified_gmt":"2024-08-22 18:38:38","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/?post_type=listing&#038;p=6012","menu_order":0,"post_type":"listing","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"9","filter":"raw"},{"ID":5854,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2017-11-01 21:53:55","post_date_gmt":"2017-11-01 21:53:55","post_content":"<strong>Menu Update:<\/strong> August 2019\n\n<span data-reactroot=\"\"><span class=\"rc-ExpandableText\"><span class=\"-expanded\">We tried some new menu items at @delforno_killarney and I must say this was one of the best restaurant experiences so far in Johannesburg.

So, when we were invited to Pizza Del Forno to try out their menu, complimentary, we accepted.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5866\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/Pizza-del-forno-Hungry-for-Halaal11.jpeg\" alt=\"Pizza del forno Hungry for Halaal\" width=\"610\" height=\"458\" \/>\n\nIf the Halaal Goods Market and Halaal Food Expo is anything to go by, you know that Jozi Muslims love their food! Finding new Halaal restaurants and cafes are worth celebrating via an explosion of instagram posts captioned #finallytriedit #gotmyfix #halaalcertified #whoopwhoop and a few squad pics at the newly launched Halaal franchises.\n\nIf you are as fussy as they come, prefer banting friendly meals or hubby prefers real meals that not only look fancy, but actually fill him up, and the kids tastes ping pong from burgers to pizzas and hot wings, Pizza Del Forno exceeds expectations.\n\nVery few actually know about this newly launched gem, so no waiting in line, unless it's Saturday night... best to call ahead and make a reservation. They are without a doubt family friendly, have baby chairs, and also cater for those in niqaab, offering the use of pardah frames. They also have their own private restroom, and even so, the public restroom are also just outside the venue.\n\nThe restaurant is beautifully designed and the decor has a sophisticated, contemporary and yet relaxed feel to it. Neat wooden flooring, a fireplace, face brick walls coupled with stone cladding, from which hang black and white photography, echoing the streets of Italy.\n\nThe seating is a combination of comfortable stand alone wooden tables and chairs, with wall to wall sofa booths. There are also 2 large screen televisions, so sports enthusiasts will rejoice! Lighting further complements the natural wood and stone finishes, with a combination of down lighters and weaved basket light fixtures that hang from the ceiling.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5865\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/Pizza-del-forno-Hungry-for-Halaal10.jpeg\" alt=\"Pizza del forno Hungry for Halaal\" width=\"610\" height=\"813\" \/>\n\nThe ambiance definitely leans towards a fine dining experience, however the pricing is reasonable, and the menu is possibly the largest Halaal menu I have seen. You will be spoilt for choice! I needed about 15 mins to finally make up my mind on what I wanted to order, and the staff and manager were more than happy to offer up their suggestions.\n\nThey offer everything from a full breakfast menu, to authentic Italian pasta dishes, pizzas made in a traditional wood burning oven, burgers and sticky wings to make their patrons go Rocco who? There's also a variety of grills, Mediterranean dishes, platters, serving chicken, seafood and beef, beverages such as mocktails and monster shakes, with a dedicated coffee bar and more! Could you say all that in one breath? And not to forget, most of it comes in either classic, traditional or gourmet alternatives.\n\nOur waiter was Sly, a hearty chap. We chose booth seats, and were served a Mediterranean platter for 2 as a starter, new on their menu, as if the menu needed any further additions. The platter was a colourful and wholesome presentation of fried haloumi cheese, sticky wings and flame grilled chourico. Each one perfectly cooked, the haloumi was soft and not overly chewy, the sticky wings were literally finger licking good, and the chourico was addictive.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5860\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/Pizza-del-forno-Hungry-for-Halaal5.jpeg\" alt=\"Pizza del forno Hungry for Halaal\" width=\"610\" height=\"813\" \/>\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5861\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/Pizza-del-forno-Hungry-for-Halaal6.jpeg\" alt=\"Pizza del forno Hungry for Halaal\" width=\"610\" height=\"813\" \/>\n\nNext we ordered our main meals, I ordered Pollo del Forno which was chicken fillets stuffed with melted brie cheese and Macon, covered in peppery Dijon mustard sauce with a side of roasted seasonal vegetables.\n\nZakariyya, my husband, opted to try their burgers, made with 100% beef patties. He chose the gourmet mexican nacho burger and requested the guacamole be excluded, as he's not an avo fan, with skinny chips on the side. They happily obliged.\n\nI enjoyed my meal, it was not my usual order, and being someone who loves to try new items on the menu, it satisfied my curiosity and appetite. The portions are huge. Hubby, notoriously fussy when it comes to eating out, actually stopped to complement the chef.\n\nDrinks were Freddo cappuccino for me and a caramel kit Kat monster shake for hubby, which was also new on the menu. If you love your coffee strong, freddo cappucino fits the bill. If you craving something sweet, their monster shakes are divine, and will satisfy any sweet tooth.\n\nDesert was a chocolate volcano, which is a hot chocolate cake with a molten chocolate centre with the kind of vanilla ice cream I love, that is not too creamy, but deliciously accompanies the chocolate volcano. Serving size is good for one.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5864\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/Pizza-del-forno-Hungry-for-Halaal9.jpeg\" alt=\"Pizza del forno Hungry for Halaal\" width=\"610\" height=\"813\" \/>\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5863\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/Pizza-del-forno-Hungry-for-Halaal8.jpeg\" alt=\"Pizza del forno Hungry for Halaal\" width=\"610\" height=\"610\" \/>\n\nDoes it meet little finger's demanding expectations? Yes, absolutely. We ordered pizzas for the kids and they loved it.\n\nI suggest you also try out their chicken schnitzel, golden crumbled goodness and their pastas and blueberry mocktail.\n\nAll in all, Pizza Del Forno is high on taste, large in portions and not too bad on the pockets.

Known for the Smashburger and bad boy image it has the young and reckless flocking to it notwithstanding ridiculous waiting times, long queues and sitting outside in the cold when all the inside tables are full. So how do you halaalify a brand built on the bikers and booze concept? Well, you focus on the shakes\u2026 and so is born the FREAKSHAKE!\n\nThe halaal branch at Melrose Arch proved no less popular than the regular branches. We showed up without a booking on a warm Saturday night at 8.30. The central court of the Melrose Arch plaza was abuzz with people out on the town. Rocomamas, which is situated around the centre court along with other restaurants has some tables outside with their signature orange umbrellas and a cosy space on the inside with lots of wood finishing.\n\nThe crowds of young people waiting outside and surprisingly, some family groups, was already an indication that we were out of luck. We were told that there would be more than an hour\u2019s waiting time. Not wanting to have dinner at 9.30 we decided to head elsewhere and opted to return in the morning for breakfast. Bet you didn\u2019t see that coming. Never thought Rocomamas was a breakfast joint did you? Well, neither did I but when the guys saw how disappointed I was at not getting a table and also realizing I would be going back to Cape Town the next day they suggested I pop in for Breakfast. Cos they\u2019re hardly ever busy then. So now you know a little secret about when you can go to Rocomamas without needing to book ahead.\n\nBut, do they have breakfast meals? Well it\u2019s not the kind of breakfast meals you might be used to but if a Breakfast Burger will work for you then absolutely yes. Bring on the eggs and lets do this brekkie. How it works is all quite fun. They bring you a tear sheet with all the basic options of burger and combinations of egg, macon, mushroom, fries, cheese etc. You choose your basic and tick off your extras and beverage choice. This is all from the breakfast menu where the basic starts at R40 for a 100g beef patty with cheddar, egg, chilli and bbq sauce on a toasted bun. The regular menu gives you the option of a standard 150g patty, or double to 2 x 100g patties or downsize to 1 x 100g patty. I found the choices quite innovative and the prices really reasonable. A cheeseburger with chips comes to R69. Not bad. Our breakfast burger which my friend and I shared looked great and flavour was good as well. We were sharing because we were planning to destroy one of their famous waffles as well. Just look at this work of art that is their Nutella Waffle. It needs it\u2019s own celebration. Having it with your meal is just too ambitious. We managed about half before we caved. This was the only item I thought pricey on the menu at R59.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5721\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/Rocomamas-Hungry-for-Halaal7.jpg\" alt=\"Rocomamas Hungry for Halaal\" width=\"610\" height=\"813\">\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5720\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/Rocomamas-Hungry-for-Halaal6.jpg\" alt=\"Rocomamas Hungry for Halaal\" width=\"610\" height=\"813\">\n\nOur waiter had also convinced us to try a small portion of the buffalo wings. I am a huge lover of chicken wings. And I am so glad I decided to try these. They were awesome. Spicy, crispy and perfectly cooked with Ranch sauce on the side.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5722\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/Rocomamas-Hungry-for-Halaal8.jpg\" alt=\"Rocomamas Hungry for Halaal\" width=\"610\" height=\"813\">\n\nSo you may think we had had enough at this point, but no, we were going for broke. With both of us leaving town that evening, we were making sure we sampled everything Rocomamas is known for. And a Slow Death by Chocolate is how we were gonna finish ourselves off on the glutton meter. This monster is not for the faint of heart. Thick chocolate milkshake infused with decadent chocolate sauce and embellished with Oreos, crushed Whispers and chocolate sticks. Just update your will before you have one of these.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5723\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/Rocomamas-Hungry-for-Halaal9.jpg\" alt=\"Rocomamas Hungry for Halaal\" width=\"610\" height=\"800\">\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBy this point I was running late for my next adventure in Jozi and after having a few sips of the shake left poor Zakkiya to try and finish off the rest by herself. I never did ask her if she got through the rest of it, hmmmm\u2026\u2026\n\nI\u2019m sorry if I sounded like I was gushing in this post. But I honestly don\u2019t have anything bad to say about Rocomamas. The service was great, the staff friendly and energetic. It was the same staff from the night before and they remembered us that morning. A lady at the next table was having breakfast with her 2 small children, so it\u2019s easy to downsize a portion for the kids. It\u2019s a bit vibey to bring the kids here at night though.\n\nI hope they open a halaal Cape Town branch real soon. They\u2019ve whet the appetite and the Mountain is waiting\u2026.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<span style=\"border-radius: 2px; text-indent: 20px; width: auto; padding: 0px 4px 0px 0px; text-align: center; font: bold 11px\/20px 'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,sans-serif; color: #ffffff; background: #bd081c  no-repeat scroll 3px 50% \/ 14px 14px; position: absolute; opacity: 1; z-index: 8675309; display: none; cursor: pointer;\">Save<\/span>","post_title":"Rocomamas, Melrose Arch","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"rocomamas-melrose-arch","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2022-03-23 23:02:00","post_modified_gmt":"2022-03-23 21:02:00","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/?post_type=listing&#038;p=5713","menu_order":0,"post_type":"listing","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"1","filter":"raw"},{"ID":5647,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2017-09-11 00:32:42","post_date_gmt":"2017-09-10 22:32:42","post_content":"We live in the information age.

She got each member of her audience to rise up and speak about themselves, who they are, what they do, how they got there, and who they would like to connect with at the venue. This took a while, but it was worth it, as my eyes opened to new possibilities. I watched women really appreciate and respect each other for their journeys. Knowing each other made all the difference and allowed many to make new business and other beneficial connections. Guest speaker\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/uyandam\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Uyanda Mbuli<\/a>, a former actress, and current Tv producer, activist and businesswomen spoke about overcoming adversity with boldness and enthusiasm.

I still think about my first back massage, facial and hand massage at the spa....I really didn't know how much I needed a hand massage till I got one. It was the perfect reset needed to tackle my stressful days after. I should know, designing can be quite laborious, especially on my hands and back. The spa is definitely worth visiting for your pamper session, as well as your highly necessary reset. The staff are friendly, respectful, always neat and committed. Outside, on the pool deck, Hair on fleek was set up, offering some beautiful deals on hair extensions and weaves. There was also Limited By Letoya with beautiful kids wear.<\/div>\r\n<div><\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5653 size-slider-thumbnail\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/Urban-Bliss-Spa-Hungry-for-Halaal6-350x350.jpeg\" alt=\"Urban Bliss Spa Hungry for Halaal\" width=\"350\" height=\"350\" \/>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5650 size-slider-thumbnail\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/Urban-Bliss-Spa-Hungry-for-Halaal3-350x350.jpeg\" alt=\"Urban Bliss Spa Hungry for Halaal\" width=\"350\" height=\"350\" \/>\r\n\r\nAlso on deck were\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/zaynah_official\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Zaynah modest apparel<\/a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/khalees_fabrics\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">KhaleesFabrics<\/a>.

Ask Aadilah Tootlah, she was there with me. They were honestly the best koeksisters I had tasted in years. I was transported to my childhood trips in Cape Town, a kid trying her very first, genuine homemade, recipe passed from generation to generation, koeksister. It was that awesome!

There were trays of chicken skewers, chicken wraps and haute bunny chows.

Known as a great coffee shop and breakfast spot, Bean Tree also offers a succulent steak menu which includes BBQ or Masala basted Fillet steak or T-Bone, chops and ribs. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>They have Salaah facilities and Wifi. Bean Tree is great for a quick meeting or hook-up with friends and family. Conveniently located with ample free and secure parking.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>--------------------------------<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p>The Bean Tree Caf\u00e9 in Obs is a little hidden gem. Situated next to the Spar on Main Road Observatory, Also known as Groote Schuur Spar due to its proximity to the hospital, you could quite easily drive right passed it\u2026 but that would be a mistake. The entrance is right off the covered parking in front of the Spar. The smell of coffee will direct you even before your eyes catch sight of the outside seating. The inside is well lit, spacious and welcoming. We chose the comfy seats and a double table so junior had space to colour and draw. That kept him busy whilst we ordered. The staff were friendly and helpful and able to suggest some options from the rather comprehensive menu.<\/p>\n<p>Breakfast is well catered for from Muesli and Yoghurt to flap jacks and French toast and the full house breakfast, omelettes and eggs benedict. There\u2019s a small salad section, a starter menu with soup, chilli poppers and nachos. Light meals including masala steak sandwich, wraps, croissants, pizza and a selection of burgers. Note to self, we are going to need to return for a second round of tasters later in the day.<\/p>\n<p>Today though was about breakfast, and we were not disappointed. Junior decided waffles and ice cream was a good breakfast choice. Don\u2019t judge, sometimes you just have to go with the flow. I opted for the man\u2019s choice, The Bean Tree Filler. Eggs, macon, sausage, mushrooms and tomato. Its tradition for me once a year on the morning after the Cycle Tour to replenish all that spent energy by having a large breakfast at a well known establishment. The bean Tree experience will be my choice for this from now on. The food was delicious, well done and more than adequate in size. D decided to have the scrambled eggs with flaked snoek and chilli. A good choice on its own but after tasting the Bean Tree Filler, the flavour was a little plain. Presentation was good and service quick. And then of course there was the coffee, which had been calling from the time we arrived. The latte and a cappuccino was our choice of poison and we were not disappointed.<\/p>\n<p>Prices are reasonable. The 2 breakfasts, waffle and latte set us back R200. The burgers start at R59, 200g Steak Fillet at R149, even the mocktails were under R40 on average. The only downside of this caf\u00e9 is its proximity to the carpark. The outside seating would have been quite pleasant despite the Astroturf, or maybe because of it... but you find yourself watching the cars as it shares the same space of the undercover parking. Once inside though, the car park right outside makes no difference. Open all week but closed on Sundays.<\/p>\n<p>At this point sadly I must confess there was no space for the cakes in the display counter. I\u2019m told the cheesecake is the bomb. Perhaps the next Cycle Tour is too far away to wait for our next visit to the Bean Tree in Obs.<\/p>\n<p>Listed 10 September 2017<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","post_title":"Bean Tree Cafe, Observatory","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"bean-tree-cafe-observatory","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2021-01-25 21:24:53","post_modified_gmt":"2021-01-25 21:24:53","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/?post_type=listing&#038;p=5635","menu_order":0,"post_type":"listing","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"2","filter":"raw"},{"ID":5625,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2017-09-08 12:52:08","post_date_gmt":"2017-09-08 10:52:08","post_content":"Bollywood Caf\u00e9 is situated on the bustling City Bowl section of Cape Town CBD.

The Schardinger raclette cheese contains animal rennet, thus its not suitable for Halaal or vegetarian customers. All the other cheeses used at Raclette are from Klein River, which is Halaal certified.<\/h4>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>Move over <a href=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/va-market-on-the-wharf-va-waterfront\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">V&amp;A Food Market<\/a>, the new Mojo Market is set to steal some market share in the 7 day a week food market scene. Capetonians may be rolling their eyes at another new market but this one has several great reasons to head out to the Point.<\/h4>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5343\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/Mojo-Market-Hungry-for-Halaal_2408.jpg\" alt=\"Mojo Market Hungry for Halaal\" width=\"610\" height=\"458\" \/>\r\n\r\nOpen all week you can pop in anytime for a bit of a foodie fix. While it is touted as a food market it is also home to local crafters and tradesman. Some beautiful handmade leather goods, jewellery and locally made clothes were on sale amidst a variety of interesting food stalls. There is everything from oysters, to shwarmas, fish and chips to chicken wings and boeries to ice cream. And something for the sweet tooth too with at least 2 dedicated coffee spots at either end.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5356\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/Mojo-Market-Hungry-for-Halaal2.jpg\" alt=\"Mojo Market Hungry for Halaal\" width=\"610\" height=\"461\" \/>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5350\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/Mojo-Market-Hungry-for-Halaal_2438.jpg\" alt=\"Mojo Market Hungry for Halaal\" width=\"610\" height=\"458\" \/>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe halaal offering was a bit thin but not absent. 2 Stands were halaal certified, Meat Up and B&amp;R Biltong, and at least 2 others told me their meat\u00a0 was from halaal suppliers. Raclette, both the name of the vendor as well as the dish they specialise in does not serve any meat at all. I was intrigued by the dish and the way it is served and decided I had to try it. I love all things cheese so I was really an easy sell. When I saw it's a plate of fried baby potatoes covered with melted swiss cheese with pickled gherkins and onions on the side it was really a no brainer. It simply had to get in my tummy. Besides, check out this video of how it's made. Who wouldn't want some?\r\n\r\n[video width=\"640\" height=\"352\" mp4=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/Raclette-Mojo-Market-Hungry-for-Halaal.mp4\"][\/video]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWe added the steak roll from Meat Up, one of the halaal vendors which does a variety of meats on long rolls, some fish and chips and a freshly made health juice of coconut water, pineapple, mint and lime from the Beet Box and headed to the upstairs seating area on the mezzanine as downstairs was pretty full already with the lunch crowd. The raclette was a lovely subtle dish, the cheese mildly flavoured and lightly dusted with just paprika and black pepper. At R80 some would say overpriced but I enjoyed it and would have it again. The pickles added just the right touch of zing to this dish. The steak roll I found a bit bland and the sweet potato fries were not seasoned. Will need to try one of the other options next time. Average price of R65. The fish and chips were exceptional. Perfectly cooked and crispy batter with chunky fries for R75. The juice was good, but at R62 I was not that impressed. I was very tempted by the sushi which looked great but they have an option that is topped with bacon so I passed.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5346\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/Mojo-Market-Hungry-for-Halaal_2424.jpg\" alt=\"Mojo Market Hungry for Halaal\" width=\"610\" height=\"430\" \/>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5348\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/Mojo-Market-Hungry-for-Halaal_2431.jpg\" alt=\"Mojo Market Hungry for Halaal\" width=\"610\" height=\"458\" \/>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe mezzanine where we sat is also a gallery with artwork from local artists adorning the walls. You could take in the vibe from the top and listen to the sweet sounds of the live singer on the small stage downstairs crooning tunes in the style of the inimitable Stacey Kent. It's busy but the vibe is quite relaxed and we didn't have to fend off hordes of people when ordering our food either. While the market is quite family friendly we noticed more than one dog while we were there. Pet people may want to skin me but I would prefer no dogs especially at an indoor food market. If you want to park off with your laptop, we saw plug points at some spots where you can plug in and still get some work done. There's some quiet little nooks if you look around.\r\n\r\nThere's an old school organic grocer, a small artisinal bakery and a butcher (not halaal), so you could even stock up on some pantry essentials if you need to.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5337\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/Mojo-Market-Hungry-for-Halaal_2401.jpg\" alt=\"Mojo Market Hungry for Halaal\" width=\"610\" height=\"458\" \/>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class=\"wp-image-5349 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/Mojo-Market-Hungry-for-Halaal_2436.jpg\" alt=\"Mojo Market Hungry for Halaal\" width=\"603\" height=\"803\" \/>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class=\"wp-image-5351 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/Mojo-Market-Hungry-for-Halaal_2441.jpg\" alt=\"Mojo Market Hungry for Halaal\" width=\"603\" height=\"453\" \/>\r\n\r\nWe wrapped up with a Baskin Robbins ice cream, this store being the only one that felt a little odd and commercial in the market, but made my 4 year old super happy and cappucino and cheesecake from the coffee spot in the corner. Excellent coffee that even Bootlegger across the street would find hard to beat and an Oreo Cheesecake that was so good it drowned out the surge of cholesterol through my arteries.\r\n\r\nThe market is located on Regent road adjoining the Mojo hotel and it has a view of the ocean from the downstairs booth seating area. So grab a table if you're there for a great late afternoon sunset view.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nRelated: <a href=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/markets-in-cape-town-with-halaal-food\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Markets in Cape Town with Halaal food.<\/a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5352\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/Mojo-Market-Hungry-for-Halaal_2446.jpg\" alt=\"Mojo Market Hungry for Halaal\" width=\"610\" height=\"458\" \/>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5354\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/Mojo-Market-Hungry-for-Halaal_2452.jpg\" alt=\"Mojo Market Hungry for Halaal\" width=\"610\" height=\"663\" \/>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5341\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/Mojo-Market-Hungry-for-Halaal_2405.jpg\" alt=\"Mojo Market Hungry for Halaal\" width=\"610\" height=\"813\" \/>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5338\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/Mojo-Market-Hungry-for-Halaal_2402.jpg\" alt=\"Mojo Market Hungry for Halaal\" width=\"610\" height=\"790\" \/>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5335\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/Mojo-Market-Hungry-for-Halaal_2396.jpg\" alt=\"Mojo Market Hungry for Halaal\" width=\"610\" height=\"458\" \/>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5357\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/Mojo-Market-Hungry-for-Halaal3.jpg\" alt=\"Mojo Market Hungry for Halaal\" width=\"610\" height=\"458\" \/>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5361\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/Mojo-Market-Hungry-for-Halaal7.jpg\" alt=\"Mojo Market Hungry for Halaal\" width=\"610\" height=\"458\" \/>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5360\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/Mojo-Market-Hungry-for-Halaal6.jpg\" alt=\"Mojo Market Hungry for Halaal\" width=\"610\" height=\"458\" \/>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"border-radius: 2px; text-indent: 20px; width: auto; padding: 0px 4px 0px 0px; text-align: center; font: bold 11px\/20px 'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,sans-serif; color: #ffffff; background: #bd081c  no-repeat scroll 3px 50% \/ 14px 14px; position: absolute; opacity: 1; z-index: 8675309; display: none; cursor: pointer; top: 204px; left: 132px;\">Save<\/span>","post_title":"Mojo Market, Sea Point","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"mojo-market-sea-point","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2022-01-26 22:51:40","post_modified_gmt":"2022-01-26 20:51:40","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/?post_type=listing&#038;p=5523","menu_order":0,"post_type":"listing","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"1","filter":"raw"},{"ID":5513,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2017-08-14 15:57:10","post_date_gmt":"2017-08-14 13:57:10","post_content":"Our burgers are available in either 100% pure ground beef (150g) or succulent chicken fillet and prepared in our signauture basting.

So why have I not visited there before? Well, the one time I did go, they were fully booked and I just may have been too hungry to wait for a table. Perhaps I should add that I showed up without a reservation.\n\nThe restaurant is headed by Executive Chef Anwar Henkeman who has been with the hotel for more than 6 years. They are known for being a destination buffet restaurant with regular Sunday buffets and special buffets for Eid and other celebration days. Their a la carte offering is not that well known. Chef Anwar has given it a new spin and I was fortunate to be invited to sample their new a la carte menu. It being a dinner reservation we were happy to be able to avoid the daytime congestion of the CBD, and parking was ample on Heerengracht street outside the hotel. There is also parking available behind the hotel on Roggebaai Square.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5489\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/On-the-Square-Capetonian-Hungry-for-Halaal14.jpg\" alt=\"On the Square Capetonian Hungry for Halaal\" width=\"610\" height=\"458\">\n\nThe small foyer before you enter the restaurant with it\u2019s deep red carpet, blue and white armchairs and animal paintings on the wall has a definite colonial feel to it. This is quite different to the restaurant itself, which is much bigger that I expected. Tiled in white floors and white walls give it a feeling of vastness. One wall is accented with a printed green wallpaper which lends a more contemporary feel. I felt the space in this restaurant as there were few tables occupied, mainly with hotel guests and one large family group enjoying the buffet, which had a good variety of dishes in spite of it being the middle of the week. We took a table at the floor to ceiling window, which literally lines one whole wall of the restaurant. I could imagine sitting here during the day and just people-watching over the busy square outside.\n\nOur lovely waitress was attentive and friendly but had to refer back to the kitchen when I asked for recommendations. We opted for the Cream of Spinach soup and the Grilled Mushrooms to start with. No mocktails on the menu so we went for Appletisers. We were presented with a basket of warm bread rolls and butter before our starters came. The portions were quite big for starters and I was glad I didn\u2019t overdo it on the rolls. The soup was simple and well flavoured but I chose not to finish it as I wanted to enjoy my main as well. The mushroom starter was really good with a lovely garlicky flavor, the salad in particular, fresh with a tangy dressing.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5478\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/On-the-Square-Capetonian-Hungry-for-Halaal3.jpg\" alt=\"On the Square Capetonian Hungry for Halaal\" width=\"610\" height=\"610\">\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5479\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/On-the-Square-Capetonian-Hungry-for-Halaal4.jpg\" alt=\"On the Square Capetonian Hungry for Halaal\" width=\"610\" height=\"565\">\n\nOur mains came shortly after, a Lemon and trio of herb Crusted Salmon served with a Dill Cream at R145 and the Surf and Turf which comes with a 250g Sirloin Steak, Cajun Calamari and Prawns for R225. I was expecting a crusted salmon steak but this dish was prepared with smoked salmon which for me was a little disappointing as the flavours are quite different. I feel the menu should have been more clear that it was smoked salmon and not a salmon steak. The salmon was artfully served atop a round of garlic bread surrounded by vegetables in a dill cream. The flavor in the dill cream smothered vegetables was quite good. Dill can be very subtle but the sauce had a nice pepperiness for heat. The steak was well done and perfectly cooked without being dry. This too was a large portion which left us too full for dessert.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5486\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/On-the-Square-Capetonian-Hungry-for-Halaal11.jpg\" alt=\"On the Square Capetonian Hungry for Halaal\" width=\"610\" height=\"610\">\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5485\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/On-the-Square-Capetonian-Hungry-for-Halaal10.jpg\" alt=\"On the Square Capetonian Hungry for Halaal\" width=\"610\" height=\"458\">\n\nBut we decided we could not round off the meal until we had tried something \"dolci\" so we chose to share a Meringue nest with berries and Chantilly cream at R65. This was a perfect end to a heavy meal. The lightness of the meringue and tartness of the berries were easy on the palate and not overly sweet. The coffees that accompanied it were just perfect. I would pop in here just for the cappucino.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5488\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/On-the-Square-Capetonian-Hungry-for-Halaal13.jpg\" alt=\"On the Square Capetonian Hungry for Halaal\" width=\"610\" height=\"813\">\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5487\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/On-the-Square-Capetonian-Hungry-for-Halaal12.jpg\" alt=\"On the Square Capetonian Hungry for Halaal\" width=\"610\" height=\"813\">\n\nThe menu includes dishes like Moules Marinieres (Mussels in Garlic and Cream) where anywhere else it would be prepared with white wine. Here you can have the wine free version and I\u2019d like to go back to try it. The recommended dishes are the grills from R175 for the Lamb Chops and seafood platters from R165 which if our portion sizes were anything to go by will be generous. They also have some vegetarian dishes and Indian curries on the menu. Desserts start at R52 for sliced fruits with Ice cream to R85 for a cheese plate.\n\nThe restaurant is showing it\u2019s age a bit and could use a modern makeover. I would take my parents there and it\u2019s a good option for large celebrations as the buffet is great value at R225 per person and offers an even bigger variety on the weekends. There is great potential at this venue. I would love to see them add some modern touches to also attract a younger market.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>The current Buffet menu\u2019s pricing as below are until 30 September 2017:<\/strong>\n\nBreakfast daily:&nbsp; R155.00 pp between 09h00 to 11h00\nMonday to Thursday dinner:&nbsp; R175.00 pp&nbsp; between 18h30 to 22h30\nFriday dinner:&nbsp; R185.00 pp between 18h30 to 22h30 between 18h30 to 22h30\nSaturday lunch &amp; dinner:&nbsp; R215.00 pp&nbsp; between 12h30 to 14h30\nSunday lunch &amp; dinner:&nbsp; R175.00 pp&nbsp; between 12h30 to 14h30\n\nUpdated: 10 August 2017\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSee also: <a href=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/halaal-buffets-and-diners-in-cape-town\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Halaal <\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/halaal-buffets-and-diners-in-cape-town\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Buffet <\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/halaal-buffets-and-diners-in-cape-town\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">restaurants in Cape Town<\/a>.\n\n<span style=\"border-radius: 2px; text-indent: 20px; width: auto; padding: 0px 4px 0px 0px; text-align: center; font: bold 11px\/20px 'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,sans-serif; color: #ffffff; background: #bd081c  no-repeat scroll 3px 50% \/ 14px 14px; position: absolute; opacity: 1; z-index: 8675309; display: none; cursor: pointer; top: 308px; left: 148px;\">Save<\/span>","post_title":"On the Square at The Capetonian, CBD","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"square-capetonian-cbd","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2022-01-26 23:13:52","post_modified_gmt":"2022-01-26 21:13:52","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/?post_type=listing&#038;p=5475","menu_order":0,"post_type":"listing","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},{"ID":5379,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2017-07-28 02:00:31","post_date_gmt":"2017-07-28 02:00:31","post_content":"<em><strong>Update:<\/strong> This is now a private Senegalese Coffee experience in Cape Town.<\/em>\n\n-------------------\n\nThe African Mall in the CBD is a real tourist trap for foreign visitors to Cape Town. In this bright blue building on Long Street you will find several tiny little shops crammed to the hilt with African curios, leather works, and food stalls. Mostly run by our African neighbours from Congo, Malawi, Senegal et al. I had recently come across a restaurant on Facebook advertising Senegalese coffee and food and also saying they were halaal. My curiosity piqued, I decided to pay them a visit.\n\nThe mall on Long street is not the modern facades that we are used to. This is an old building sandwiched among more old buildings on this iconic street. It is not that well kept so you may not be easily enticed to go inside. It is worth a visit though if you are keen on african ornaments, fabrics and prints. The Congolese shop at the entrance was packed to the hilt with pretty jewellery, decor and ornamental bowls. I succumbed to a set of pearl shell salt and pepper shakers before I had left. Is R75 a lot to pay for a salt shaker? ???? hmmm, I may have been bamboozled by a savvy saleswoman...???? On the upside, card facilities were also available.\n\nKhadim's Coffee is upstairs on the first floor. It shares the space with 2 other eateries and a few shops which mostly were closed when I was there which was a weekday morning. It's a quiet space with not much traffic. A place mostly frequented by people who know about it. The shop has 2 smallish tables and a coffee table flanked by wooden 2 couches. When I walked in Khadim who co owns the shop was in deep conversation with someone who was obviously a regular over the counter. I took a seat at the bar counter and was offered a menu by the friendly owner. The speciality is the Senegalese coffee, a Toubacino which is what I ordered along with some fresh baked Beignets.\n\nWhile I was waiting 2 other regulars walked in. A really big burly guy and a little guy who both made salaam and then ordered sandwiches. They sat at the counter and rapped away with Khadim while he prepared them. It was apparent that the client base here is mainly people from the North African community who come here for this particular type of food.\n\nMy coffee was ready and Khadim explained the difference about Senegalese coffee. Along with coffee beans, what is known as Guinea Pepper is also ground into the coffee mix giving the resulting brew a spicy and peppery flavour. It was served in a glass like a latt\u00e9 but the drink was stronger than any latt\u00e9 I've ever had. Not as strong as Turkish coffee, and more drinkable I would say. The beignets were like stiff little bollas, not too sweet but I found them a little dry for my taste.\n\nKhadim's has sandwiches available on a daily basis and prepares one traditional meal per day. So you'd have to get the speciality of the day if you're planning to go there for a meal. Meals are authentic Senegalese dishes like Yassa and Thiere accompanied with rice or couscous and traditional sandwiches. You could also find out of the ordinary dishes like peanut butter rice or okra sometimes on the menu. It was too early for me to try any food so I'm not able to elaborate much on the flavours one could expect. Khadim is Muslim and tells me he buys his meat from Bismillah Grand Parade Butchery.\n\nThis was an interesting venture for me and for something out of the norm, worth a visit.\n\n<span style=\"border-radius: 2px; text-indent: 20px; width: auto; padding: 0px 4px 0px 0px; text-align: center; font: bold 11px\/20px 'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,sans-serif; color: #ffffff; background: #bd081c no-repeat scroll 3px 50% \/ 14px 14px; position: absolute; opacity: 1; z-index: 8675309; display: none; cursor: pointer;\">Save<\/span>\n\n<span style=\"border-radius: 2px; text-indent: 20px; width: auto; padding: 0px 4px 0px 0px; text-align: center; font: bold 11px\/20px 'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,sans-serif; color: #ffffff; background: #bd081c  no-repeat scroll 3px 50% \/ 14px 14px; position: absolute; opacity: 1; z-index: 8675309; display: none; cursor: pointer;\">Save<\/span>","post_title":"Khadims Coffee, Cape Town CBD","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"khadims-coffee-cape-town-cbd","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2024-12-10 20:37:13","post_modified_gmt":"2024-12-10 18:37:13","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/?post_type=listing&#038;p=5379","menu_order":0,"post_type":"listing","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},{"ID":5328,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2017-07-12 01:36:25","post_date_gmt":"2017-07-11 23:36:25","post_content":"Chilli Chocolate Chefs is an established chef sister act in the culinary world of KwaZulu-Natal.\r\n\r\nThe chefs are graduates from two of South Africa's renowned chef schools, Christina Martin and Fusion Cooking School.

The family that brought you <a href=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/city\/cape-town\/listing\/roggeland-country-house-paarl\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Roggeland Country House<\/a> is now expanding their footprint in the Winelands and bringing you another halaal estate where you can book accomodation, a function venue and get it fully catered as well.\r\n\r\nWe were invited recently by the Moerats to view their new Guesthouse Klein Nederburg. The hall on the property had been booked for a wedding which made it an ideal opportunity to experience the ambiance of a function at the venue. The drive to Paarl from the Northern Suburbs was about 30 minutes and the estate was easy to find. On entering into the grounds you drive down an unpaved farm road under a canopy of trees. The banqueting hall is the first thing you see on the way to the guesthouse.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5081\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/Klein-Nederburg-Hungry-for-Halaal15.jpg\" alt=\"Klein Nederburg Hungry for Halaal\" width=\"610\" height=\"458\" \/>\r\n\r\nThe hall is in the Cape Dutch style and can seat 200 people. A balcony at the top makes an ideal space for namaaz (prayer) or for extra seating. I peeked into the hall and as the function had not officially started was able to look around and take a few photos.\r\n\r\nThe open doors at the entrance made for a beautiful backdrop of the Paarl Valley for the bride and groom.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5090\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/Klein-Nederburg-Hungry-for-Halaal.jpg\" alt=\"Klein Nederburg Hungry for Halaal\" width=\"610\" height=\"458\" \/>\r\n\r\nThe lawns outside are an ideal space for the kids to run around. When we arrived it was Thuhr (prayer) time, and because it was quite a hot day, they had set up for namaaz under trees. What a beautiful sight this was. To pray in congregation with your loved ones in the beauty of nature.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5070\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/Klein-Nederburg-Hungry-for-Halaal4.jpg\" alt=\"Klein Nederburg Hungry for Halaal\" width=\"610\" height=\"458\" \/>\r\n\r\nThe Moerat family takes care of all your needs for your function. The decor as well as the food. I was able to take some pics of the activities while they were plating the crayfish starters. One of the advantages of checking out new places is that you often get to taste and sample. I can definitely vouch for the food. The crayfish starter was both pretty and tasty, and I later tasted the best paella I have had yet.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5068\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/Klein-Nederburg-Hungry-for-Halaal2.jpg\" alt=\"Klein Nederburg Hungry for Halaal\" width=\"610\" height=\"458\" \/>\r\n\r\nThe guesthouse is a self catering venue. It has six guest suites, each one has been individually furnished. All rooms have en-suites with air conditioning, hair dryers and tea\/coffee making facilities, DSTV and complimentary WIFI. Some rooms have their own private terrace. The guesthouse also has a lounge and a swimming pool (which was under maintenance at the time I was there) with plenty of space to unwind. The room names and wall paintings is still from the previous owners and these will be changed soonest I am told by the Majied Moerat. It is still a very new addition to their stable and some work must still be done. The kitchen is quite big and has all the amenities. It could use a little tlc though and could be modernised a bit.\r\n\r\nThe open plan lounge and dining room has a fireplace. The dining table is a six seater and will need extending if a bigger group is booking. The kitchen has a larger table though. There is an outside braai area available on the stoep.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5075\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/Klein-Nederburg-Hungry-for-Halaal9.jpg\" alt=\"Klein Nederburg Hungry for Halaal\" width=\"610\" height=\"458\" \/>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5072\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/Klein-Nederburg-Hungry-for-Halaal6.jpg\" alt=\"Klein Nederburg Hungry for Halaal\" width=\"610\" height=\"813\" \/>\r\n\r\nBrides often book a room in the guesthouse for changing or preparing for their function. This could even be a nice option for just getting the whole family to stay over the night before the wedding.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful scenery of the Drakenstein mountains in the background, the green lawns under the trees and the rolling farmlands makes for a wedding photographers dream. It's a tranquil space where you can get away from the city without needing a visa...\r\n\r\nListed: 19 May 2017\r\n\r\n<span style=\"border-radius: 2px; text-indent: 20px; width: auto; padding: 0px 4px 0px 0px; text-align: center; font: bold 11px\/20px 'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,sans-serif; color: #ffffff; background: #bd081c  no-repeat scroll 3px 50% \/ 14px 14px; position: absolute; opacity: 1; z-index: 8675309; display: none; cursor: pointer; top: 3206px; left: 129px;\">Save<\/span>","post_title":"Klein Nederburg Guesthouse, Paarl","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"klein-nederburg-guesthouse-paarl","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2019-03-28 14:07:15","post_modified_gmt":"2019-03-28 14:07:15","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/?post_type=listing&#038;p=5065","menu_order":0,"post_type":"listing","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},{"ID":5005,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2017-05-04 21:59:08","post_date_gmt":"2017-05-04 19:59:08","post_content":"<a href=\"https:\/\/muggandbean.co.za\/downloads\/pdf\/Mugg-and-Bean-summer-halaal-menu-2019.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CLICK HERE FOR THE SUMMER MENU 2019<\/a>.\n\n<span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">HOUSE REVIEW<\/span>\n\nKenilworth Centre in the Southern Suburbs of <a href=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/5-great-breakfast-spots-in-cape-town\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cape Town<\/a> has become a hotbed of halaal eateries. Some of the long standing restaurants have become halaal with the new revamp of the mall late last year and others opening up have seen the value of going halaal. Mugg &amp; Bean is a new addition to the mall and is currently the only halaal branch of this popular franchise in the country.\n\nWe visited on the long weekend only to find a 20 minute queue before we could get a table. On speaking to the manager I was told that this has been the case every weekend since they opened. Suffice it to say, Muslim foodies have been waiting eagerly for another halaal branch since the Vangate Mall branch closed a few years ago.\n\nWe decided to wait and finally got a table (yes, I know it was only 20 minutes, but when you have a restless 4 year old in tow who was promised waffles and ice cream, it can feel like 2 hours). In spite of the restaurant being full to capacity, the service was efficient and we didn't wait long for our food. The menu is the same as all the other branches with the obvious substitutions for halaal meat.\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/Mugg-Bean-Hungry-for-Halaal4.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5010\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/Mugg-Bean-Hungry-for-Halaal4.jpg\" alt=\"Mugg &amp; Bean Hungry for Halaal\" width=\"610\" height=\"470\"><\/a>\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/Mugg-Bean-Hungry-for-Halaal3.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5009\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/Mugg-Bean-Hungry-for-Halaal3.jpg\" alt=\"Mugg &amp; Bean Hungry for Halaal\" width=\"610\" height=\"458\"><\/a>\n\nA range of decadent looking breakfast options were tempting so we opted for the Big Ben and the Famous One breakfast. <span class=\"font-heavy\">The Big Ben is an impressive looking<\/span> toasted English muffin topped with baby spinach, fresh tomato, hashbrowns, cheddar, turkey, macon, deep-fried onion rings &amp; two poached eggs, drizzled with hollandaise sauce.

The<span class=\"font-heavy\"> Famous One consists of<\/span> two eggs, macon, a sweetcorn fritter, grilled tomato &amp; rosemary-salted fries, served with a slice of toast. This was quite filling for the hubby. I quite liked the sweetcorn fritter myself. The gooseberry and apple ice tea was quite good and it being sugar free was a guilt-free delight. I liked the brand new black crockery and interesting serve ware for the milk. Of course we could not do Mugg &amp; Bean without trying the coffee. The medium strength filter coffee blend was just perfect.\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/Mugg-Bean-Hungry-for-Halaal2.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5008\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/Mugg-Bean-Hungry-for-Halaal2.jpg\" alt=\"Mugg &amp; Bean Hungry for Halaal\" width=\"610\" height=\"610\"><\/a>\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/Mugg-Bean-Hungry-for-Halaal1.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5007\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/Mugg-Bean-Hungry-for-Halaal1.jpg\" alt=\"Mugg &amp; Bean Hungry for Halaal\" width=\"610\" height=\"716\"><\/a>\n\nTaufeeq was promised waffles, and to our disappointment we discovered that Mugg &amp; Bean no longer does waffles. But we managed to avoid drama and tears with a kiddies order of chocolate chip flapjacks and ice cream. The kiddies order was really just one big flapjack and we had to order a second portion for him as he enjoyed it so much, and like Oliver, looked up with those pitiful puppy eyes and I just melted. At R79 and R69 for the breakfast dishes I thought pricing was ok. But I thought R21 for the single kiddies flapjack and ice cream a tad overpriced and R29 for a small kids milkshake is definitely too steep.\n\nThe fact that it was so busy made it quite noisy and a bit rushed. I'd like to go soon at a quieter time and have a more relaxed meal. There's some interesting breakfast skillets on the menu including Shakshushka as well as a Sesame Crusted Buttermilk Chicken Burger that almost won over the Big Ben. But all in all a good experience. I was very impressed that they did not drop the ball the entire time we were there in spite of the crowd.\n\n<em>Listed: 4 May 2017<\/em>\n\nAlso in Kenilworth Centre: <a href=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/city\/cape-town\/listing\/dulce-cafe-kenilworth\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dulce Cafe, Kenilworth<\/a>\n\n<span style=\"border-radius: 2px; text-indent: 20px; width: auto; padding: 0px 4px 0px 0px; text-align: center; font: bold 11px\/20px 'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,sans-serif; color: #ffffff; background: #bd081c no-repeat scroll 3px 50% \/ 14px 14px; position: absolute; opacity: 1; z-index: 8675309; display: none; cursor: pointer; top: 2262px; left: 106px;\">Save<\/span>\n\n<span style=\"border-radius: 2px; text-indent: 20px; width: auto; padding: 0px 4px 0px 0px; text-align: center; font: bold 11px\/20px 'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,sans-serif; color: #ffffff; background: #bd081c no-repeat scroll 3px 50% \/ 14px 14px; position: absolute; opacity: 1; z-index: 8675309; display: none; cursor: pointer; top: 898px; left: 126px;\">Save<\/span>","post_title":"Mugg & Bean, Kenilworth Centre","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"mugg-bean-kenilworth-centre","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2020-09-30 15:56:40","post_modified_gmt":"2020-09-30 15:56:40","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/?post_type=listing&#038;p=5005","menu_order":0,"post_type":"listing","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"8","filter":"raw"},{"ID":4930,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2017-04-10 15:38:54","post_date_gmt":"2017-04-10 13:38:54","post_content":"Jassiem Grill Shack is a home based \/ Food trailer 100% Halaal on the move take-aways.\r\n\r\nWhatsapp to order and collect on Fridays and Saturdays.","post_title":"Jassiem Grill Shack, Kensington","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"jassiem-grill-shack-kensington","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2019-03-28 13:55:36","post_modified_gmt":"2019-03-28 13:55:36","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/?post_type=listing&#038;p=4930","menu_order":0,"post_type":"listing","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},{"ID":4605,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2017-01-19 21:35:28","post_date_gmt":"2017-01-19 19:35:28","post_content":"This week I had a real African experience in Woodstock. And not just because of the restaurant I visited. Our Northern African neighbours have become a part of the real fibre of Woodstock increasing the diversity of this Cape Town Improvement District. I was heading for Andalousse Moroccan, a newly opened spot of just on 4 months. It's hard to spot as the sign is small but it's right across the Woodstock Police station. Anyone who knows my love hate relationship with Woodstock, will know that this is already a plus in my books.\n\nWe found parking fairly close to the restaurant. Walking down the short length of sidewalk towards it, we passed a tiny little shop outside which a lady was just starting a fire over a grill, kind of like the tikka guys in the Indian neighbourhoods. I was curious to know what would be on sale, but you'll have to wait till the end of this post to discover that.\n\nThe entrance to the restaurant is gated off by a big metal gate. Not pretty from the outside but a necessary safety feature for the area I guess. Inside is a different story. It's not a very big space. A long working counterspace stretches across one side and the other houses 3 comfortable booths big enough for about 6 people each. The front of the store has a larger booth space for a bigger group. Care has been taken to deliver an authentic Moroccan feel. The deep earth and rustic colours resonate with the clay Moroccan patterned tagines and silver teaware lining the counter top. Islamic artwork is set high up on the one wall and Moroccan patterning adorns the front of the long counter.\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/Andalousse-Hungry-for-Halaal-4.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-4614\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4614\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/Andalousse-Hungry-for-Halaal-4.jpg\" alt=\"Andalousse Hungry for Halaal\" width=\"610\" height=\"458\"><\/a>\n\nWe are warmly welcomed and seated by Moosa who is one half of the partnership that owns the restaurant. He is also the chef and waiter on this day. He brings us some menu's and immediately goes off telling us he will be back right away. The feel is of being in a someone's home. The handful of men in the restaurant look middle eastern and are obviously friends of the owner. They mill about for a while and eventually take their leave as more customers appear. A group of tourists fill up one booth and a group of regulars come by to collect an order. They enjoy some Mint Tea while their order is being prepared.\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/Andalousse-Hungry-for-Halaal-3.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-4613\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4613\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/Andalousse-Hungry-for-Halaal-3.jpg\" alt=\"Andalousse Hungry for Halaal\" width=\"610\" height=\"458\"><\/a>\n\nA few minutes later Moosa reappears with a wooden tray adorned with dainty glasses, an ornate pot of Moroccan tea and a plate of biscuits that look like Italian biscotti but which he calls Fakhaas (I hope I remembered that correctly ????). He pours the hot green tea over fresh mint into the glasses and we sip at the delicious brew while enjoying the biscuits peppered with almonds and flavoured with a hint of aniseed. Moosa has left us some books about Morocco to look at while we are waiting. A nice touch to whet our appetite for more of the culture. We peruse the menu trying to decide what to choose. There is the expected mezze available with a selection of hummus, baba ganoushe, labneh and zaatar. I was happy to note that they also had some simple pizza options which would work for my little one who's palate is just not that adventurous yet. Grills in the way of chicken or kofta kebabs, shawarmas and different types of tagines all were very tempting and making a choice was difficult. He suggested we have the Kofta Kabab as that included all the items on the Mezze platter plus the Koftas. A half portion would be fine as we would also try the Chicken Tagine with olives. We ordered a medium Chicken pizza for T to be on the safe side.\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/Andalousse-Hungry-for-Halaal-8.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-4618\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4618\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/Andalousse-Hungry-for-Halaal-8.jpg\" alt=\"Andalousse Hungry for Halaal\" width=\"610\" height=\"427\"><\/a>\n\nNow this turned out to be a lot of food. The tagine at R120 contains half a chicken and along with its vegetables and flat bread could easily serve 2 people. The chicken was tender and falling off the bone. The dish had a mild flavour with slight fruity notes due to the olives. The half portion Kofta Kabab at R50 contains 2 generously sized koftas, salads and dips and could be a full meal. The full portion is R80 and contains 3 koftas. The beef koftas were spicy without being too hot. The smokey Baba Ganoush was delicious as was the hummus. The medium pizza topped with Moroccan spiced chicken, pineapple and avo was delicious and a total steal at R50. In total our bill came to R240. The prices in general are very reasonable and there is no skimping on portion sizes.\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/Andalousse-Hungry-for-Halaal-10.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-4620\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4620\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/Andalousse-Hungry-for-Halaal-10.jpg\" alt=\"Andalousse Hungry for Halaal\" width=\"610\" height=\"458\"><\/a>\n\nI spotted a hooka pipe in the corner and was told that they only light up late evenings and always check with dining patrons if it's ok. They are looking into setting up a hooka lounge at the back of the venue but it's still in the pipeline. I ventured to the toilet to wash my hands and it's clean but could really use some work. I liked the very relaxed vibe of the place. While the finishes are rough, the care and passion for the business clearly shows and hospitality was at the forefront. I felt well looked after and considered. And the clincher for me was to discover that on packing our leftovers they had cling wrapped the leftover tagine so it would not spill out of the container and mess the packet or our car. Simple thoughtfulness like that is what makes me want to go back.\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/Andalousse-Hungry-for-Halaal-13.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-4623\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4623\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/Andalousse-Hungry-for-Halaal-13.jpg\" alt=\"Andalousse Hungry for Halaal\" width=\"610\" height=\"458\"><\/a>\n\nSo stepping out of Andalousse and back into Woodstock, we head back to our car. Just one door over we pass a pub just starting to get busy and almost at the car, the lady has her wares on the fire. Thick fat sausages and...... Chicken Feet! Yep, I felt like I had been taken back to my Malawi days. Aaaahh Africa, you are so at home in Woodstock.\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/Chicken-feet.jpeg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-4624\"><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-4624\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/Chicken-feet.jpeg\" alt=\"Andalousse Hungry for Halaal\" width=\"368\" height=\"245\"><\/a>","post_title":"Andalousse Moroccan Cuisine, Woodstock","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"andalousse-moroccan-cuisine-woodstock","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2022-01-26 22:57:24","post_modified_gmt":"2022-01-26 20:57:24","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/?post_type=listing&#038;p=4605","menu_order":0,"post_type":"listing","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"3","filter":"raw"},{"ID":3572,"post_author":"40","post_date":"2017-01-12 16:22:18","post_date_gmt":"2017-01-12 14:22:18","post_content":"Osman's Foods is a Cape Town based catering business.\r\n\r\nHaving an Indian heritage, they grew up with a passion for aromatic spices and fresh ingredients.

The Butcher's wife is a new addition but mostly in name only. This casual eatery has been re-invented from the franchise based Italian pizzeria that it was before and is now an on trend little stop for pizza, pasta's and grills.\n\nThey used to be a St Elmo's which was bought over by another big Italian franchise which uses electric pizza ovens instead of clay ovens. To their great credit, the owners would not cave to the electric ovens and decided instead to re-brand with a new and improved offering. They still bring you clay oven pizzas and Italian pastas but now also offer burgers, grills and even prawns. We popped in late one weekday evening. They were quiet save for one other table. I really like the blue walls and dark wood rustic tables. The decor would make this place really trendy if it was situated in Cape Town CBD or Greenpoint.\n\nThe counter dominates the one side of the store where you can come and collect your phone in order, but we were shown to a table and sat down to order. We opted for the Masala Steak Pizza and Basil and Pesto Pasta. The pizza was delicious. The masala flavour was spicy and tasty without being too hot and the crust was thin and crispy. My pasta flavour was good and the sauce creamy. I found the chicken was chopped up too small and was a bit like mince instead of cubes. But I enjoyed the flavour. I really liked the crockery that that the food was served in. The blue pattern on the off white stoneware added to the rustic appeal of the decor. It was nice that they chose non-generic serving ware. It gives the restaurant that bit more of its own character.\n\nThe carrot cake we chose to share for afters was just perfect. Moist and delicious with a rich cream cheese topping. I also tried a new milkshake on the menu they had just added. A Caramel Popcorn gourmet shake. I honestly did not expect to enjoy it as much as I did. The popcorn flavour really came through and they use actual popcorn blended in to the shake so if you don't like texture in your shake, give this one a miss, but I loved it. It could have been presented a bit more artfully though perhaps in those mason jars that are so popular for milkshakes now but the classic conical milkshake glass did not take anything away from the flavour.\n\nPrices are pretty much on par for what you pay at most pizza places. Our meal in total for 2 including drinks, coffee and a dessert to share came to R230. They have a lengthy list of pizzas that I am keen to try but I will be happy to go back just for that masala steak pizza.","post_title":"The Butcher's Wife, Belgravia","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"butchers-wife-belgravia","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2019-06-12 19:28:06","post_modified_gmt":"2019-06-12 19:28:06","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/?post_type=listing&#038;p=4448","menu_order":0,"post_type":"listing","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"11","filter":"raw"},{"ID":4440,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2016-11-25 15:29:41","post_date_gmt":"2016-11-25 13:29:41","post_content":"A new sushi delivery service in Cape Town's Southern Suburbs.

Of course with this balmy weather an indoor market works better and so almost as a \u201dplan B\u201d we visited the Root 44 Market in Stellenbosch. Situated near the Mooiberg strawberry farm between Stellenbosch and Somerset West, it turned out to be a great outing. To start off with there was ample and secure parking and being the last weekend of the school holidays it was full even though the sky looked ready to pour at any moment, sort of \"pregnant with precipitation\" if you like. Immediately junior saw something that piqued his interest, a huge kiddies play area and for the rest of the morning we had to hear \u201d I wanna go to the jungle gym now.\u201d\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/IMG_8824.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-4255\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4255\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/IMG_8824.jpg\" alt=\"route 44 Hungry for halaal\" width=\"610\" height=\"458\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\nSo after a sprint through the traders area, we finally got to the World of Adventure. For R80 the kids get access to everything for the whole day and R10 for each accompanying minder. Mini golf, ball pen and a snazzy play gym was just the start. And different areas for up to five years and another for older kids. Peddle cars, sand pit, slip n slide and the piece de resistance, the zip line. All this fun is going to make any child hungry not to mention the hovering parent. So it's a good thing that there are a couple of food stalls in this area to provide some comfort. Milkshakes, waffles, filter coffee and candy floss to name a few and all well placed to get the little ones attention. After all they are in charge. The play area is well staffed at each play section and there is sufficient seating for minders and outdoor tables for that chocoloate and strawberry waffle and coffee. You are also able to book the play area for kiddies parties. You can bring your own cake and party packs but all food must be bought from the market.\r\n\r\nEventually after much negotiating and a toy bribe, we got out of the play area and on to the food area. Immediately the aroma got your stomach growling if you hadn't reached that point as yet. From around twenty different options, sadly only three were halaal for typical meals. A fish place with no beer in the batter, a Baba Tunisia, a shwarma and Tunisian food stall and an Indian food stall. Then there was a stall that did Turkish delight with no gelatine, The Creamery for ice cream, a freshly squeezed juice stall and the very decadent sweet counter. None of these are certified halaal but I do know that Baba Tunisia is Muslim owned.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/IMG_8787.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-4247\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4247\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/IMG_8787.jpg\" alt=\"route 44 Hungry for halaal\" width=\"610\" height=\"458\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/IMG_8784.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-4246\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4246\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/IMG_8784.jpg\" alt=\"route 44 Hungry for halaal\" width=\"610\" height=\"458\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\nI had a fully loaded shwarma which was nice, though the meat was medium to well done. I prefer my meat dead but that's just me. The sauce, veg and overall flavour was good and very filling. D had calamari and chips and junior had fish nuggets. The calamari was cooked just right and the chips were chunky cut and very acceptable. We shared a fresh juice that looked very pretty but was average at best and junior then opted for a chocolate ice cream with jelly tots which gets mashed together in The Creamery signature style. Of course he had no problems with that. The prices overall were not too bad and the vibe in the place was relaxed and festive. A nice experience on the whole.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/IMG_8782.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-4244\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4244\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/IMG_8782.jpg\" alt=\"route 44 Hungry for halaal\" width=\"610\" height=\"458\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/IMG_8804.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-4250\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4250\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/IMG_8804.jpg\" alt=\"route 44 Hungry for halaal\" width=\"610\" height=\"458\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/IMG_8832.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-4256\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4256\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/IMG_8832.jpg\" alt=\"route 44 Hungry for halaal\" width=\"608\" height=\"608\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\nThere is an outside tented section where there was live music, of the classic variety, Beatles and the like. They served fresh oysters and alcohol was available in this section. For me oysters are best eaten in Knysna and everywhere else is just imitation. As we made our way out, we passed through the design tent which was a little dissapointing. Furniture made from wine barrels and a rather unusual idea of using copper piping in shelves, side tables, and stools was about the only thing that caught my fancy. The last stop was the deli where they have some standard country fair such as pickles, chutneys and the like. In the car before he passed out from exhaustion and the long drive home, junior made me promise that we would come back to the adventure world with his cousins so they can play lots and lots. Turned out to be a great day and well worth the drive out.\r\n\r\nThe market is open every Saturday and Sunday from 10am till 4pm come rain or shine.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"border-radius: 2px; text-indent: 20px; width: auto; padding: 0px 4px 0px 0px; text-align: center; font: bold 11px\/20px 'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,sans-serif; color: #ffffff; background: #bd081c  no-repeat scroll 3px 50% \/ 14px 14px; position: absolute; opacity: 1; z-index: 8675309; display: none; cursor: pointer; top: 1086px; left: 167px;\">Save<\/span>","post_title":"Route 44 Market and World of Adventure","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"root-44-market","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2022-01-26 22:37:37","post_modified_gmt":"2022-01-26 20:37:37","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/?post_type=listing&#038;p=4233","menu_order":0,"post_type":"listing","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},{"ID":4023,"post_author":"169","post_date":"2016-09-16 16:09:32","post_date_gmt":"2016-09-16 14:09:32","post_content":"<h2><!-- [if gte mso 9]&gt;--><\/h2>\n<!-- [if gte mso 9]&gt;-->\n<h5><!-- [if gte mso 9]&gt;--><\/h5>\n<!-- [if gte mso 9]&gt;-->\n\n<!-- [if gte mso 9]&gt;-->\n\n<!-- [if gte mso 9]&gt;-->\n\nInspirational, convenient and professional, The Academia is a multi-purpose conference and event destination in Cape Town. <span lang=\"EN-GB\">Whether the purpose of your visit is strictly business or more informal, The Academia will serve your event with the excellence it deserves.

I knew this was a popular restaurant but was not prepared for just how busy they were at 3pm on a Sunday afternoon. The large hall-like space was packed. Long tables seating rows of families and large groups alongside smaller table settings. It was noisy and packed but there seemed to be a definite air of organised chaos amidst it all.\n\nI had called ahead about 45 minutes before to check if they were wheelchair friendly and they were able to accommodate us with a removable ramp for my mum. Also, because I had phoned ahead they kept us a table, which I think we would have had to wait for had we just pitched up. We were seated at a table near the door which was very roughly set with a few random plates on the table. Not a very inviting setting as if it had just been vacated and was in the process of being set. We were also seated with the speaker right behind us and while it wasn't very loud it did make conversation difficult. I was on the verge or re-thinking our choice of venue but decided that I needed to lighten up and just go with the experience.\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/Village-Buffet-Hungry-for-Halaal-1.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-3725\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3725\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/Village-Buffet-Hungry-for-Halaal-1.jpg\" alt=\"The Village buffet Hungry for Halaal\" width=\"610\" height=\"458\" \/><\/a>\n\nThe restaurant is Indian owned who also owns the Food Inn restaurants in Cape Town and Rondebosch. The streetstyle food served there has been a successful formula and this venture into the buffet scene seems to be doing equally well. This is a casual, unassuming space. You go here because you are serious about having not only a good meal but also a large meal. The variety of food is larger than many other buffets and you should probably skip a meal in order to do this visit justice.\n\nWe were seated without any ceremony and after waiting for some direction from a waiter and getting none, decided to just head over to the buffet and see what's what. I started with some sushi, paapar (poppadums) and a potato kofta. There was much more to sample in the starter section in the way of salad and vegetables, but I wanted space to try everything. The sushi was quite acceptable but very basic rainbow rolls and fashion sandwiches. Mostly vegetarian and crabstick types.\n\nI then went for a round of mains which included some savoury rice, Chicken Jalfrezi, Jeera Aloo (Cumin Potato fry), some sausage and onions more suited to a breakfast buffet, some prawns and calamari. I had little bits of everything so I could get a taste of the whole menu. The Chicken Jalfrezi was the star of this plate. A warm, rich and spicy flavour with tender cubes of chicken. The sausage is of the few that I have tasted that I have actually liked, also a bit on the spicy side. The calamari and prawns were both a little plain but the calamari was perfectly cooked and tender. A little tartare sauce would have gone a long way but I don't recall seeing it on the buffet. I tasted a bit of the chicken biryani from my sons plate which was delicious and the seafood paella from hubby's plate was spicy and tasty but the calamari in it had gotten chewy and the only other seafood in it was prawns.\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/Village-Buffet-Hungry-for-Halaal-11.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-3735\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3735\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/Village-Buffet-Hungry-for-Halaal-11.jpg\" alt=\"The Village buffet Hungry for Halaal\" width=\"610\" height=\"458\" \/><\/a>\n\nMy second plate had some grilled bbq chicken which was good, dhal, butter chicken and lamb curry. The dhal was delicious, spicy and hot with fresh chillies. The butter chicken I found too sweet and the lamb curry was dissapointingly bland. I did not have any more room to taste the ribs which I believe is popular.\n\nDessert options included waffles and ice cream, Malva pudding cubes and custard, some marshmallows on a stick and a chocolate fountain. While there were several flavours of ice cream they had all gone soft, so dessert was not the finest experience. The malva pudding cubes while tasty, had gotten chewy and hard, being in the bain marie for some time, and could not really be enjoyed. I thought they could have made a lot more effort with dessert.\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/Village-Buffet-Hungry-for-Halaal-15.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-3739\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3739\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/Village-Buffet-Hungry-for-Halaal-15.jpg\" alt=\"The Village buffet Hungry for Halaal\" width=\"610\" height=\"582\" \/><\/a>\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/Village-Buffet-Hungry-for-Halaal-17.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-3741\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3741\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/Village-Buffet-Hungry-for-Halaal-17.jpg\" alt=\"The Village buffet Hungry for Halaal\" width=\"610\" height=\"458\" \/><\/a>\n\nWaiters cleared plates from the table between trips to the buffet and refilled the bottomless sodas included but it was random and I think they could have used a few more waiters.\n\nA 10% service charge was also automatically added to our bill which I was not happy with as we were only 3 adults and a child.\n\nThey have a 2 hour rotation which means you're expected to eat and be done in 2 hours to make space for the next sitting.

The Legal cafe operates on Saturdays from 9am - 1pm\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color: #e00707;\">HOUSE REVIEW<\/span>\r\n\r\nNot in a million years would I have pegged Salt River Market as a go to place to locate a funky restaurant. Located behind the iconic Good Hope butchery, right on the busy Salt River circle, the market certainly has an abundance of history and old world charm. The area always drumming with traffic, both cars and people, noisy, crazy and busy is more known for the industry, the dodgy shops and prolific crime. However, the city's initiative to uplift key areas known as Improvement Districts have seen positive changes here and in adjoining areas like Woodstock. The old Salt River Market is undergoing a facelift and it's here that The Market Deli has decided to open up shop.\r\n\r\nZ and I snuck out midweek for a quick lunch date. Having heard about the deli via the grapevine and not knowing too much about what to expect we were basically prepared for anything. And finding this little gem, incongruously tucked into the corner of ye olde Market, actually made my day. The deli is bright and airy inside. Not at all small as you'd expect a deli to be. Quite big enough to take a decent crowd. Funky bright red plastic chairs offset dark solid wood tables. The walls are adorned with shelves carrying ornaments and paintings depicting the history of Cape Town, Salt River and District Six. Old decorative tea tins you may have seen in your grandmothers house sit alongside copper pots and old steel milk cans. It's a visual and historic feast and it feels like home.\r\n\r\nWhen we got there they had just been cleaning the floor and the smell of detergent was a bit strong. But we were welcomed warmly by the host Amina Osman, and shown to a table. She proceeded to chat animatedly to us about the menu and what was on offer. I opted for the unusual, a Venison Burger, I had never had venison before and was being adventurous, and a chocolate milkshake. Z had the Beef Burger. The menu is not huge, 3 types of burgers, some wraps, salads and stir fries. They are still busy tweaking their menu. Considering they are open barely 3 weeks, a lot of it is work in progress for now.\r\n\r\nAmina proceeded to tell us more about the Market Deli while we waited for our order. Owned by herself and 4 others, the restaurant helps them facilitate other initiatives they are passionate about. Right next door they have opened \"The Legal Cafe\". Two of the owners are lawyers and together with other lawyers offer legal consultations at a very affordable rate here. So you can meet with a lawyer to just discuss an issue and pay a small fee, before breaking the bank to take matters further if at all necessary. They also run a Youth Leadership programme which has been going since 2009. The restaurant has already hosted a programme on Human Rights Day with students from various schools being addressed by leaders in the community. The deli also has a Single Mothers programme where they aim to help single mothers by stocking products made by them for sale in the deli.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/IMG_6399.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3014\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/IMG_6399.jpg\" alt=\"The Market Deli Hungry for Halaal\" width=\"392\" height=\"585\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, our burgers had arrived. I liked the presentation on craft wooden boards and unexpectedly, the burger came with all the trimmings, cheese, pineapple and egg. Luckily, I was fine with all of that but do say something if you're not into any of that as the menu does not specify what is all on the burger. The venison, which is supplied by 2 of the partners who hunt and slaughter it halaal themselves, was a bit gamey but I enjoyed the flavour and did not mind the distinctive taste at all. Z, too was very happy with his burger. The chips I would have preferred crispier, but everyone likes their chips a different way. These were quite acceptable. My Nutella shake was good - thick and tasty - yes, my detox was \"na die maan\" (out the window).\r\n\r\nIt's casual and family friendly. Prices are quite reasonable. Burgers start at R60, Wraps R60 and Stir Fry R85. Our meal totalled R180. The venue has ample parking. Downside is that they don't have their own toilets yet. They do use the market toilet and have one designated only for their customers that is locked and kept clean by them. They are in the process of getting their own. Upside is that they have Salaah facilities on site with a Wudhu khanna.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/IMG_6403.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3016\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/IMG_6403.jpg\" alt=\"The Market Deli Hungry for Halaal\" width=\"390\" height=\"524\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\nI really like the social conscience behind this restaurant. I think that these are the types of initiatives suited to the whole idea of uplifting the area and it's people and I think that Salt River Market will likely see more new and trendy spots opening alongside The Market Deli.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"border-radius: 2px; text-indent: 20px; width: auto; padding: 0px 4px 0px 0px; text-align: center; font: bold 11px\/20px 'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,sans-serif; color: #ffffff; background: #bd081c no-repeat scroll 3px 50% \/ 14px 14px; position: absolute; opacity: 1; z-index: 8675309; display: none; cursor: pointer;\">Save<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"border-radius: 2px; text-indent: 20px; width: auto; padding: 0px 4px 0px 0px; text-align: center; font: bold 11px\/20px 'Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,sans-serif; color: #ffffff; background: #bd081c no-repeat scroll 3px 50% \/ 14px 14px; position: absolute; opacity: 0.85; z-index: 8675309; display: none; cursor: pointer; top: 1790px; left: 184px;\">Save<\/span>","post_title":"The Market Deli, Salt River","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"the-market-deli-salt-river-2","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2020-02-09 12:06:09","post_modified_gmt":"2020-02-09 12:06:09","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/?post_type=listing&#038;p=3020","menu_order":0,"post_type":"listing","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"3","filter":"raw"},{"ID":2666,"post_author":"40","post_date":"2016-03-18 15:17:36","post_date_gmt":"2016-03-18 13:17:36","post_content":"This is an intimate Muslim owned establishment which is a converted house and is suitable for smaller functions.

And they have not disappointed. The new venue at the Clock Tower Building, V&amp;A Waterfront is a fantastic location with splendid views and facilities. We were invited to attend their grand opening which promised to be a glorious foodie affair. Rafieka gives us the low-down.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Saray first opened five years ago and was located in the CBD area. The new premises at the V&amp;A Waterfront is easily accessible with the closest parking being at Silo District.&nbsp; I arrived to find a tastefully decorated entrance area with balloon arch, beautiful flowers and red ribbon for the ribbon cutting ceremony. After snapping some pictures I was warmly welcomed by the hostess. She followed Covid protocol and dispensed sanitizer to all guests upon entry. The seating area was huge, offering both indoor and outdoor seating. This allowed for ample social distancing.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The restaurant d\u00e9cor is opulent with royal blue and emerald green chairs, beautiful Turkish lanterns, a Turkish flag painted on one wall and hints of golden serving dishes and cups. There is also a hookah station situated in between the indoor and outdoor seating areas. I loved the huge clay pizza ovens visible to guests in the one section of the restaurant.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Almost everyone decided to be seated outdoors. The outdoor seating is the best I have experienced in a long time, offering beautiful views without compromising on d\u00e9cor or service. They have artificial grass as well as beautiful floral arrangements all around the outdoor seating area.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The waitrons proceeded to serve starters to each table. This consisted of a fruit platter, a meze platter, flatbread and falafel. There was also a platter of boregi, cheese filled pastry, which was a taste sensation as well as kibbe, coated stuffed meatballs.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The owners, Naadiya Moosajee and her husband Veysel Dogan, officially opened the restaurant with the ribbon cutting ceremony. Naadiya then addressed everyone and chatted about their journey arriving at this relaunch. She mentioned that they have faced several challenges along the way, particularly with trying to source things directly from Turkey. Despite all the hurdles, the relaunch was finally happening. The excitement was palpable. Both Naadiya and Veysel are gracious hosts and visited all the tables chatting to guests along the way. Their aim was to allow everyone to have a taste of Turkey.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For mains I ordered the Et Sis, which was grilled beef fillet with chips and rice. Others at my table ordered lamb shank and a creamy chicken pasta. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed their meals though I felt the beef fillet cubes were slightly overcooked. To drink I had a mojito and an ayran, a traditional Turkish yoghurt drink. Both the mojito and the ayran were refreshing. For dessert I chose the Sutlac, a creamy rice pudding. This was delicious and not overly sweet. Other guests at my table ordered the brownie and the kunefe. Both of these desserts were enjoyed, particularly the kunefe.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Several people ordered a hookah which was a hit. I think the bonus was that the outdoor seating allowed for this quite easily without affecting people who are non-smokers.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The waitrons were warm, friendly and eager to assist. They were knowledgeable about the menu when I asked about the dishes. The restaurant offers high chairs for children and has their own on-site restrooms. The menu is very similar to what Saray offered before and the food hits the sweet spot for lovers of Turkish cuisine. As for the new location, that in itself was a wow factor for me. My first thought was that I would definitely visit them again soon, this time with friends or family in tow.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I can definitely say I was blown away by the attention to detail, effort and passion that was put into the restaurant, the d\u00e9cor, the food, the service and the relaunch itself. This restaurant is without a doubt a labour of love for Naadiya and Veysel.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:media-text {\"mediaType\":\"image\",\"mediaWidth\":17} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text alignwide is-stacked-on-mobile\" style=\"grid-template-columns:17% auto\"><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Rafieka-profile-picture-crop.jpg\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\"><!-- wp:paragraph {\"editorskit\":{\"devices\":false,\"desktop\":true,\"tablet\":true,\"mobile\":true,\"loggedin\":true,\"loggedout\":true,\"acf_visibility\":\"\",\"acf_field\":\"\",\"acf_condition\":\"\",\"acf_value\":\"\",\"migrated\":false,\"unit_test\":false},\"editorskit_typography\":{\"name\":\"\",\"family\":\"\",\"weight\":\"\"}} -->\n<p><strong>By Rafieka Banderker<br><\/strong>Accountant by profession, writer at heart.

We were seated by a friendly middle eastern waiter and proceeded to order a Spicy Lamb Kebab, a Tavuk Sote which is chicken cooked in a tomato sauce with vegetables, topped with cheese and served in a clay dish with lavash bread, as well a Karides Guvec which is similar to the Tavuk Sote, just with Spicy Shrimp in stead of chicken. These came to the table sizzling in their clay bowls. The kebab was tasty as we opted for the spicy version. The Sote and Guvec with the melted cheese was yummy. We scooped up the saucy, cheesy affair with the turkish bread on the side. I found the shrimp version a little undercooked. I like my prawns a bit drier. Bit we all enjoyed our dishes.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If it wasn't so late I would have ended with dessert or the apple mint tea. They have a small dessert selection but only the baklava is Turkish. Would be great is they added a few more Turkish dessert options. Alas, the clock was ticking and babysitters had to be relieved.

You could spend as much time looking for parking as it took you to get to town in the first place. And then when you get back from your meeting, engagement, etc., you've got to sell your right arm to pay for said parking. No wonder Uber is becoming more and more popular. It can really take the anger out of parking rage. And that is the first reason I liked Saray restaurant; there's lots of parking. Granted, I was there on a Sunday but it's situated in a complex where there is a car park and and it's a bit removed from all the office buildings so the battle for parking will at least be a little less \"Game of Thrones\".<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Saray is a very recent addition to Cape Town's repertoire of halaal dining, bringing authentic Turkish-Kurdish food to the Cape Town CBD. We went for lunch on a Sunday. It was quiet with only 2 other tables occupied but got a little busier as it got past 1 o' clock. The large double volume space gives a sense of vastness yet it's not a huge restaurant but there is also outside seating and it can accomodate quite a large crowd. We were seated at an inside table against the wall which is lined with bench style seating. The rich red of the upholstery and table cloths lend an exotic air. Conical copper lamps hang low from the ceiling and at night I'm sure this lights up into a warm haven. The big windows all round allow in lots of light and the white solid plastic chairs and rough cement floor lends an overall feel that is casual and bright.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"center\",\"id\":2827,\"linkDestination\":\"custom\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/IMG_5887.jpg\"><img src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/IMG_5887.jpg\" alt=\"Saray Restaurant Hungry for Halaal\" class=\"wp-image-2827\"\/><\/a><\/figure><\/div>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Upon being seated my 3 year old, as 3 year olds are wont to do, immediately needed the loo. The restaurant does not have a loo inside, but the complex does and the waiter took a walk outside with us to point out the toilets. We waited quite long before they came to take our order and considering they were not busy, I was getting a little antsy. When they did come service was very attentive. The waiter had a thick middle eastern accent though and there was a bit of difficulty with communication when he was explaining the various unfamiliar dishes but we managed and he was able to get his explanation across. We ordered a meze starter which came with 5 dips including hummus, aubergine, tzaziki and 2 flatbreads. The mixing and matching of the dips made for interesting combinations. There was an option of a 1l carafe of lemonade which we ordered. I know that Ocean Basket also offers this in several flavours.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"center\",\"id\":2829,\"linkDestination\":\"custom\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/IMG_5890.jpg\"><img src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/IMG_5890.jpg\" alt=\"Saray Restaurant Hungry for Halaal\" class=\"wp-image-2829\"\/><\/a><\/figure><\/div>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As I was on my detox plan I ordered a vegetarian dish of assorted vegetables cooked in a tomato sauce. It's not served with any starch so I asked for flat bread to go with it. Z ordered the Kofte which is meatballs served with rice and a side of chips. Two starches seemed odd but we went with it. This dish was bit dry and could have used some kind of sauce. The taste as with most middle eastern food was quite mild. My veggies were tasty though and I didn't miss the heat that I am used to. It's quite interesting that the ingredients and spices of middle eastern and Indian food are so similar but the flavours in the end so different. The middle eastern palate favours less heat and spiciness yet the climate in the 2 areas are very similar.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The menu offers breakfast dishes as well but they only open at 11am on weekends. They also have an extensive list of starters and some light meals I'd still like to try. The dessert menu is small but we ordered an ice cream for my little one. It came in a parfait glass with pieces of mango in it which he wanted nothing to do with so reluctantly (not) I had to help him with his dessert. We finished off with Turkish Coffee for hubby which was presented in a pretty decorated esspresso cup and served with a little nugget of Turkish Delight. Inspite of the fact that I'm more of a coffee drinker, I tried the Turkish Apple tea. It was an excellent choice with a smooth and rounded consistency and surprisingly intense flavour.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"center\",\"id\":2834,\"linkDestination\":\"custom\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/IMG_5901.jpg\"><img src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/IMG_5901.jpg\" alt=\"Saray Restaurant Hungry for Halaal\" class=\"wp-image-2834\"\/><\/a><\/figure><\/div>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>They offer shisha pipes as well.

Primi Xpress in Rosmead hosted a meetup of Zomato foodies and other food bloggers and treated us to a night of food and comedy. I was giggling through most of my meal on Tuesday night as Yaseen Barnes and Dalin Oliver shot the breeze and put the mike through it's paces.

We ordered some drinks. They offered mocktails on the menu so I decided to blow the no dairy rules and went for a Pina Colada. It was thick and creamy, a bit more like a milkshake really. We kicked off with grilled halloumi on lettuce wraps topped with a spicy tomato relish. Loved this and was surprised to find it on an Xpress menu. This was accompanied by platters of Rosemary Salt Focaccia with a Recco and Napoletana sauce. The Recco sauce has a creamy and spicy curry inflused flavour and is a definite winner. This is a great starter but I had to resist tucking in too much as the delicious salty, herby crusty bread would just fill you up too fast.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"center\",\"id\":3881,\"linkDestination\":\"custom\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/Primi-Xpress-Rosmead-Hungry-for-Halaal-1.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-3881\"><img src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/Primi-Xpress-Rosmead-Hungry-for-Halaal-1.jpg\" alt=\"Primi Xpress Rosmead Hungry for Halaal\" class=\"wp-image-3881\"\/><\/a><\/figure><\/div>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"center\",\"id\":3882,\"linkDestination\":\"custom\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/Primi-Xpress-Rosmead-Hungry-for-Halaal-2.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-3882\"><img src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/Primi-Xpress-Rosmead-Hungry-for-Halaal-2.jpg\" alt=\"Primi Xpress Rosmead Hungry for Halaal\" class=\"wp-image-3882\"\/><\/a><\/figure><\/div>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"center\",\"id\":3887,\"linkDestination\":\"custom\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/Primi-Xpress-Rosmead-Hungry-for-Halaal-7.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-3887\"><img src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/Primi-Xpress-Rosmead-Hungry-for-Halaal-7.jpg\" alt=\"Primi Xpress Rosmead Hungry for Halaal.

I was distracted by the show which because of the confined space felt very intimate and like if you made eye contact too much, you'd get picked on. I never sit in the front rows at comedy shows, and this felt very front row to me. In the process my pasta got a little cold before I could get stuck in. I thoroughly enjoyed the Recco con Pollo which was the same spicy sauce served with the focaccia. The Calabrese was a fresher, lighter pasta dish with olives, garlic, chilli and fresh rocket.

The Quattro Formaggi was my favourite. The slight blue cheese flavour and onion marmalade paired so well together. The Moroccan Chicken was tasty but super hot. I did not manage a taste of the Tre Carne, but it looked decidedly meaty as the name suggests. This was followed by 2 sliders. One with Beef and egg and the other with grilled Chicken on a sesame bun. At this stage, in spite of my best intentions I was starting to feel like the Oros Man, and only managed a bite of each. They were quite beautifully presented but I wasn't wowed by the flavour. It's not their core offering and it's the Italian that Primi does well, not the American. Dessert was little mini ice cream sundaes which wrapped the meal up quite nicely.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"center\",\"id\":3890,\"linkDestination\":\"custom\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/Primi-Xpress-Rosmead-Hungry-for-Halaal-10.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-3890\"><img src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/Primi-Xpress-Rosmead-Hungry-for-Halaal-10.jpg\" alt=\"Primi Xpress Rosmead Hungry for Halaal\" class=\"wp-image-3890\"\/><\/a><\/figure><\/div>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Prices start at R75 for pasta up to R139 for a seafood pasta.

A full range of pizzas, burgers, wraps and sandwiches, coffees, teas and a small range of desserts. It's all there.

Seeing the prevalence of Diabetes and blood pressure issues within their own families, they recognised the need for a change from the poor eating choices within the broader Muslim community.\r\n\r\nWhile sugar free, low carb and banting friendly food is not unusual to find, it is not so accesible to the Muslim community when you have to be certain of it's halaal source. Urban low carb aims to service this gap and make healthy halaal food more accessible.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/IMG_4016.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1934\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/IMG_4016.jpg\" alt=\"Urban Low Carb Hungry for halaal\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/IMG_4010.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1929\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/IMG_4010.jpg\" alt=\"Urban Low Carb Hungry for halaal\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/IMG_4008.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1928\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/IMG_4008.jpg\" alt=\"Urban Low Carb Hungry for halaal\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\nAt the launch I sampled platters of trout ribbons, on roast veg and cream cheese pesto on handmade cocoloaf. I especially enjoyed the brinjal with roasted beetroot. A variety of quiche and cheescakes made it hard to decide where to begin. I so regretted stopping for lunch before I came. I sampled a thin sliver of the Chocolate brownie vanilla baked cheesecake with the plan to keep space for a sample of something else. Naadia revealed that the other Vanilla baked cheescake with Berry Coulis had a touch of cayenne in it to cut the tartness of the berries, so I simply had to try that. It was delicious but look out for the after-kick of a slight heat in the throat. We were offered a take home sample of their home-made granola which I had yesterday. I'm not really a granola lover, but I enjoyed the roasted and toasty flavour of this mix.\r\n\r\nUrban Low Carb does specific products to order and can also take on catering for your small party or function.\r\n<span id=\"react-root\"><\/span>","post_title":"Urban Low Carb","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"urban-low-carb","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2019-03-28 14:11:20","post_modified_gmt":"2019-03-28 14:11:20","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/?post_type=listing&#038;p=2145","menu_order":0,"post_type":"listing","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},{"ID":2063,"post_author":"29","post_date":"2016-01-13 14:02:59","post_date_gmt":"2016-01-13 12:02:59","post_content":"<p style=\"margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;\"><span style=\"color: #c0272a;\"><strong><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"line-height: 115%; font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">LISTING SUBMITTED CONTENT<\/span><\/span><\/strong><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"line-height: 115%; font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">The Noble Lodge is the definition of hospitality!

Gone are the days when you entertained 1000 people for a wedding, rolled out white butcher paper onto trestle tables and served Akhni in plastic bowls and Marshals in the bottle. We have since progressed to smaller functions, linen covered tables and catered services. What we still do see is the plastic bottle of soda that encroaches into that carefully constructed sea of bridal elegance and cheekily maintains its place on the table as if challenging you to find a better option, which we know sadly is very lacking in the halaal beverage market.\r\n\r\nAnd this is where products like Zari come to the rescue. With it's stunning bottle it can enhance even the most discerning table. Zari is the brainchild of Silvana Dantu and Shareen Parker, who both hail from the local tourism industry. Recognising a gap in the market for a sophisticated non alcoholic beverage they decided to produce a high end sparkling grape juice that could serve that gap.\r\n\r\nWith halaal tourism on the increase they are able to cater to increasing Muslim tourists from the Middle East as well as pregnant woman and teetotalers. Zari has also been featured at the Gulfood Show at the Dubai World Trade Centre in February this year, and have landed a distribution deal with the Lulu Hypermarket chain in Dubai.\r\n\r\nThe producers of Zari have sent me a sample of both their red and white sparkling juice and asked me to write a few words about it. This is my honest opinion.\r\nThe bottles had to be chilled in the fridge as it\u2019s best served ice cold I was advised by Shareen. After unwrapping the foil I carefully removed the cork and was surprised by the distinctive loud pop which I was not expecting. I poured the white into a stemmed goblet and the red into a tumbler. Shareen tells me that the typical wine glass is too big for this drink and they are developing a specific sized glass which will be the right size for it.\r\n\r\nPersonally I don't like grape juice especially white grape juice. And the first sip I had of the Zari white didn't do it for me. However, as I took a second sip, I could appreciate its smooth texture and quite liked the subtlety of the bubbles, very unlike the windy bubbles in soda, but still found the juice a tad too sweet. The red however, was more my thing. Slightly drier and less sweet. The flavour is simple, as it's pure grape juice from the Muscat Seedless Cultivar and nothing else. No added sugar or artificial colourants.\r\nI had opened both 750ml bottles so I could taste them both, but having been sealed with a cork, re-sealing presented a problem. So I had to improvise a little. They are however producing screw cap bottles and cans to enter the market later this year. The 750ml bubbly is currently priced at R60 a bottle.\r\n\r\n<span lang=\"EN-GB\">ZARI Sparkling Grape is available at selected Pick n Pay and SPAR stores, hotels and speciality stores.\u00a0 It can be ordered online at www.zari.co.za or contact sales@zari.co.za. <\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","post_title":"ZARI Sparkling grape juice \u2013 Celebrate Openings!","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"zari-sparkling-grape-juice","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2019-03-28 09:36:06","post_modified_gmt":"2019-03-28 09:36:06","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/?post_type=listing&#038;p=1583","menu_order":0,"post_type":"listing","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"1","filter":"raw"},{"ID":1582,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2015-11-28 00:28:16","post_date_gmt":"2015-11-27 22:28:16","post_content":"The FreshStop at Caltex concept was developed by the Fruit &amp; Veg City group, in conjunction with Chevron SA, in an attempt to create a world-class forecourt convenience format for the South African market.

I first came across the range at an Islamic expo a few years ago. I bought a product but then didn\u2019t see it again in any mainstream stores. Recently I\u2019ve decided to go more natural with my skin care. I\u2019m not big on daily routines, in fact I\u2019m terrible at sticking to even the basic cleanse, tone and moisturise.\n\nI\u2019ve realised however that the years are moving forward not backward and I\u2019m going to have to start taking care of my skin sooner rather than later. So in the spirit of wanting to go more natural and short of rubbing a raw avo on my face every morning I decided to look up the Angela Wall range as its basis is the most natural, Honey, Almond and Rooibos.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/4.bp.blogspot.com\/-ne1sxKHzQgc\/U2D4uRSio2I\/AAAAAAAAAks\/TTC4n_IGoyA\/s1600\/alcfreeslide.jpg\"><img class=\" alignleft\" src=\"http:\/\/4.bp.blogspot.com\/-ne1sxKHzQgc\/U2D4uRSio2I\/AAAAAAAAAks\/TTC4n_IGoyA\/s1600\/alcfreeslide.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"320\" height=\"163\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a>\nThe range originates in London, therefore, Angela Wall of London. In the late 1940\u2019s, British singer and actress, Angela Wall, opened her exclusive beauty salon in Hanover Square, London. Her clients, who reportedly included members of the Royal Family, were treated with her own brand of all-natural beauty creams.\n\nLegend has it that the creams were based on recipes developed centuries earlier in a convent in France. There nuns produced the creams using ingredients from the Abbey grounds and sold them to raise funds, but Angela Wall improved and perfected the product and the brand name \u201cAngela Wall\u201d was established. Seventy years later the Angela Wall of London products are manufactured exclusively in South Africa and recreated to suit today\u2019s woman.\n<a href=\"http:\/\/2.bp.blogspot.com\/-RoubFweexrk\/U2D5Yx6Yz6I\/AAAAAAAAAkw\/RCKRfMHSBEA\/s1600\/honeyspoon.jpg\"><img class=\" alignright\" src=\"http:\/\/2.bp.blogspot.com\/-RoubFweexrk\/U2D5Yx6Yz6I\/AAAAAAAAAkw\/RCKRfMHSBEA\/s1600\/honeyspoon.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"213\" height=\"320\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a>\nI had an informative chat with the owner of the business, Shanaaz Solomons, after which I had the special treat of a mini facial to try the products. I have a sensitive skin so was a bit nervous as to how my skin would react. After cleansing with the special cleansing bar, toning and applying the deliciously rich skin food, my skin felt fresh and smooth. No burning or sensitivity at all.\n\nI was also treated to the honey healer which is a great all round nourishing cream which can be used as anything from a day cream, to a lip balm to treating blemishes.\u00a0he range does not contain any alcohol and it\u2019s probably the only range in SA to have halaal certification. The product is not tested on animals and does not contain any harmful ingredients. And gents, just in case you\u2019re feeling a little left out, they are in the process of developing a range for men as well. Look out for that coming soon.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/-n0jZgT8gA2A\/U2D5Y4JILFI\/AAAAAAAAAk4\/lEM9CWUfxZ4\/s1600\/honeyhealer.jpg\"><img class=\" alignleft\" src=\"http:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/-n0jZgT8gA2A\/U2D5Y4JILFI\/AAAAAAAAAk4\/lEM9CWUfxZ4\/s1600\/honeyhealer.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"320\" height=\"294\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a>\nIt\u2019s a range on par with your <a href=\"http:\/\/www.shzen.co.za\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sh\u2019zen<\/a> or <a href=\"http:\/\/www.environ.co.za\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Environ<\/a> I would say, but it\u2019s fairly easy on the pocket. A 50g skin food goes for R130 making a beauty routine quite affordable. They also have travel packs at about R170 which include cleanser, toner, and moisturiser so you try all the products at a great price. Trust me, you will be back for the rest.\n<a href=\"http:\/\/2.bp.blogspot.com\/-9EIrfI3pj50\/U2D5ZJJ6f4I\/AAAAAAAAAk0\/cVQFrLQ4eV8\/s1600\/perfume.jpg\"><img class=\" alignright\" src=\"http:\/\/2.bp.blogspot.com\/-9EIrfI3pj50\/U2D5ZJJ6f4I\/AAAAAAAAAk0\/cVQFrLQ4eV8\/s1600\/perfume.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"320\" height=\"294\" border=\"0\" \/><\/a>\nIn an effort to keep it exclusive and also affordable you won\u2019t find it in mainstream department stores.\n\nCurrently you can find Angela Wall in a few select Salons and Pharmacies or from an agent in your area. The brand is also all about empowering women and offers a direct selling business opportunity.

If you don't know what a savouring is then you're probably one of many. And if like me you like interesting condiments and food accessories then you'll love this. Fynbos foods specialises in condiments made with chillies and their stand at the show proved to be a real hit.\r\n\r\nThey have a huge range of jams, pickles, pasta sauces and their unique savourings. I decided to try the savouring as I'd never had it before. Their most popular one is the smoked chillies flavour and upon sampling I understood why. The flavours of the sundried tomatoes, aubergines, oregano and basil is perfectly offset by the woody flavour of the smoked habanero chillies. It's not hot though so can be served to anyone with a milder palate. I have it now with anything from a fried egg to on my toasted cheese sandwhich. Loving it. The savourings of which there are 3 flavours, are perfect as a topping for pizza, salad, pasta, sandwiches and cheese. Delicious in stir fries, stews, omelettes, lasagne and rice dishes.\r\n<div class=\"body\">Fynbos Foods is a small family business which was founded in 1996. Situated in the Swartland area approximately 55km outside of Cape Town, the farm is off the N7 in a small farming district called Tierfontein. They are dedicated to growing quality sweet peppers, chillies (12 varieties), tomatoes, aubergines and sweet basil. They have a gourmet commercial kitchen which makes handmade products, providing employment for the community. They bottle the finest range of products for the local and overseas markets. All of the products have NO preservatives, NO colorants, and NO flavourants, NO artificial anything. The products are pasteurized giving them a shelf life of at least 2 years.<\/div>\r\nTheir products are all certified halaal and currently available in some Spar stores. They are still small so not available everywhere. I reckon they'll get popular real soon though so look out for them on the shelves.\r\n<div class=\"separator\"><\/div>","post_title":"Fynbos Foods Pickles, Jams and Savourings","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"fynbos-foods-pickles-jams-and-savourings","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2019-03-28 09:36:05","post_modified_gmt":"2019-03-28 09:36:05","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/?post_type=listing&#038;p=1428","menu_order":0,"post_type":"listing","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},{"ID":1426,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2015-11-21 22:30:44","post_date_gmt":"2015-11-21 20:30:44","post_content":"A popular family friendly franchise restaurant serving Pizza and pasta.\r\n\r\nSee a comprehensive house review of the Kenilworth branch here to give you an idea of the menu and ambiance: <a href=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/city\/cape-town\/listing\/panarottis-kenilworth-centre\/\">https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/?p=1333<\/a>\r\n\r\nThe Vangate Mall branch has a unique three story kids play area which makes it a great option for family outings.","post_title":"Panarottis, Vangate Mall, Athlone","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"panarottis-vangate-mall-athlone","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2019-03-28 14:00:01","post_modified_gmt":"2019-03-28 14:00:01","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/?post_type=listing&#038;p=1426","menu_order":0,"post_type":"listing","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"1","filter":"raw"},{"ID":1383,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2015-11-21 17:21:11","post_date_gmt":"2015-11-21 15:21:11","post_content":"<div class=\"separator\">HOUSE REVIEW<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div class=\"separator\">I first discovered amir at the Food and Hospitality World show earlier this year.

It has been developed precisely because a gap in the market was recognised by Leonard Arangies from The Art of Taste. <\/span><\/div>\n<div class=\"separator\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"separator\">After visiting Turkey in 2008, Leonard realized what a huge opportunity there was in the market for an adult non-alcoholic drink. In Turkey, as in many other non-drinking countries, the dining table is elaborate and laden with beautifully prepared foods and family recipes often passed down from generation to generation, only to be paired with sugary soda pop and unimaginative fruit juice blends which <span class=\"quote2\"><span class=\"quote2\">are simply too sweet to pair well with food. He saw that <\/span>Arab &amp; Muslim weddings were in great need of such a product and set about to develop exactly that<\/span>.Back home in South Africa Leonard started by blending grape juice and tea whilst often adding indigenous herbs in order to find the correct balance and taste profile. Depending heavily on his knowledge of wine this process was time-consuming, but thorough. After a year, six unique drinks had been crafted, each of which had to be paired with a specific food. Leonard embarked on an international road trip to countries such as India, Oman, Bahrain, Dubai and Saudi Arabia. It was important to test the taste profile and also to find packaging that would not offend any culture. The product was very well received and Amir is the first flavour to be commercially packaged. It has gone on to receive the award for Mihas Best Product at the World Halaal Week Expo in Kuala Lumpur.<\/div>\n<div class=\"separator\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"separator\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"separator\">While it is doing well internationally, it is still pretty difficult to get hold of the product locally. I did manage to meet with Leonard who was kind enough to drop me some samples so I could taste it for myself. After an interesting conversation about how the palatte works and anticipates various flavours I felt that bit more educated in the Art of Taste (sorry, couldn't resist).<\/div>\n<div class=\"separator\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"separator\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"separator\">I enjoyed my amir experience with some lovely local cheese, pesto and crackers. I chilled the bottle in the freezer till it was frosty before opening. The taste was intense and fruity.

But I got it into my head recently that I wanted pizza and I didn't want it takeout. So I figured if we got pizza at a family friendly place and stuck my cellphone in my little one's hands for an hour (don't judge me, I can see you just rolled your eyes) we would get some peace to eat our pizza fresh and hot like normal folk. Was I ever so wrong...\n\nThis halaal banch of Panarotti's is in the Kenilworth Centre Mall. It's located on the first floor at the entrance to the parking lot and I suggest using this entrance if that's the only place you're going and you have small children with you, and I'll tell you why. We came up from downstairs and passed those little ride-on horses and cars for small children on the way to Panarotti's. Suffice it to say, when my little caught a whiff of that, all hope of eating in peace went out the window. Not even sacrificing my data bundle to Thomas the Train Youtube clips could hold him back for any significant length on time.\n\nWe got seated and a very patient waiter took our order through a constant refrain of \"daddy, I want to ride the chook chook\". Perhaps he was used to this kind of thing. It being \"Beeeeg on pizza, Beeeeg on family\" after all. Catering to this they had a little games room that the kids could play video games in and get some colouring pages and crayons. What's nice is that they had a camera in there with a monitor facing the diners so you could watch your kid while having your meal.\n<div class=\"separator\">We had a starter of cheezy garlic twists which tasted great but filled us up too much to fully enjoy our pizza. We did a half n half pizza option for the main and went with half Mexicana and half Deboned beef ribs and steak. I enjoyed the Mexicana much more than the Deboned ribs and steak which I found too sweet. The kids menu is well catered for with a complete separate menu and not just a little add on at the bottom. Their pizzas all have the classic thicker pizza base. I'm partial to the thin crispy bases but you'll have to choose a different venue for that. I don't know of any fully halaal sit down venues that offer it, but&nbsp;Debonaires does it as a new menu option.<\/div>\nWe spent most of the evening eating separately with one of us shuttling the little guy to ride-on or taking him to the playroom or pulling him off the neighboring booths while the other could eat.

She is however still running her catering business from home and Insha Allah will at some point in the future look at opening up a shop again. She is still contactable on the same number for orders.\r\nWishing you all the best Zaheera.\r\n\r\n<strong>HOUSE REVIEW<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThis venue is a cute little place on Protea road in Claremont run by Professional Chef, Zaheera. I was meeting a friend for coffee and it's just as well that it's on one of the more well known roads because there's no signage outside the store making it a bit hard to find. It's only because I'd seen the logo on Facebook and knew the colour scheme that I was able to recognise the turquoise and brown colours before I drove right past it.\r\n\r\nThe decor of the tiny store and quirky furniture makes the place fun and interesting. It's a bit of an Alice in Wonderland feeling with glass topped tables set on podiums of tiered cake structures and the centre display of a delicious looking range of cupcakes and treats arranged around a leaning tower of cake.\r\n\r\nStaring down a Ferrero Chocolate Ganache or Red Velvet Cream Cheese cupcake, I chickened out and opted for a lemon meringue tart but had to try the hot chocolate and my friend was limited to a brownie as she wanted a sandwich which also looked good on the menu, but it was late in the day and they didn't have any more bread or croissants to make sandwiches, which was on the menu. This was disappointing, as the mark of a good place is that they would dash out to the nearest store and buy what they needed. Unfortunately, all we got here was a shrug.\r\n\r\nWe tried the sweets anyway. My lemon meringue tart was good and the hot chocolate did not disappoint. It's served with a chocolate spoon that you stir into the cup and allow to melt away or eat up half melted as I did.\r\nThe venue is still a bit rough around the edges and could use some finishing touches to really be highty tighty but it's fun and quirky and although I haven't tried many of the menu items yet I've heard rave reviews about the cakes. They also do bespoke cake orders and the venue can be booked for an occasion.","post_title":"High Tea Tighty, Claremont","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"high-tea-tighty-claremont","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2019-03-28 09:26:26","post_modified_gmt":"2019-03-28 09:26:26","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/?post_type=listing&#038;p=1331","menu_order":0,"post_type":"listing","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},{"ID":684,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2015-11-04 14:59:22","post_date_gmt":"2015-11-04 12:59:22","post_content":"HOUSE REVIEW\n\nHere is a restaurant that has really stepped up over the last few years and come into it's own. La Rocca has in the past usually been a last choice for me, however, since discovering their excellent Rocky Steak Burgers, they have become a firm favourite.\n\nLocated downstairs at the No.1 entrance at Canal Walk, it has a casual and inviting vibe. It's unassuming and best of all lacks pretension. It's in the middle of the aisle and has something of a sidewalk cafe kind of feel, just inside a mall. It's great for a quick bite before you head home&nbsp;or for coffee and cake when you want something sweet. And their breakfast is not bad either.\n\nThe service is not bad if you consider that they turn around customers pretty quickly. It's seldom that I've passed by and they haven't been busy.\n\nThe menu is mostly light meals with some great Tramezzinis and the Rocky burgers rival the Spur anytime.\n\nI always have the steak version though, and the steak is always just right. Last night I tried their Mexican Delight, which is a soft Tortilla filled with beef or chicken and refried beans, salsa and guacamole on the side. I was actually surprised at how good it was. Firstly, a generous portion and secondly tasted so authentic, I could have been at Panchos. They also make a great mango juice, thick and smooth. Another of my usuals. My only complaint is that their pasta portions are a little small. So if the guys at La Rocca are reading this, how about making your pastas a weenzy bit bigger. And bring back the Al Forno Carne. Really liked that.\n\nLa Rocca is making a real effort with their menu. The quality is consistent and they cater for their Muslim&nbsp;patrons every year&nbsp;with something to break fast with at iftaar.\n\nThe food is well prepared, the service efficient. They can really hold their own among the other restaurants at Canal Walk.\n\nReviewed June 2016","post_title":"La Rocca, Canal Walk (CLOSED DOWN)","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"la-rocca-canal-walk","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2024-08-20 14:30:26","post_modified_gmt":"2024-08-20 12:30:26","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/?post_type=listing&#038;p=684","menu_order":0,"post_type":"listing","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"1","filter":"raw"},{"ID":361,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2015-11-04 13:30:06","post_date_gmt":"2015-11-04 11:30:06","post_content":"HOUSE REVIEW:\n\nSo I finally made it to the Taj Mahal, after a long drive from the Northern Suburbs along the coast in Summer. Always a beautiful drive. We live&nbsp;in such a beautiful city.\n\nThe Taj Mahal is run by Pukka Pakistanis... from Pakistan.... No really, this is the real deal. Pakistani waiters, head bobbling, Indian accents deluxe. There's great potential here. The food is really good, but I found it expensive for the overall experience. The restaurant runs a takeaway downstairs and upstairs is the sit down area. The decor is spare. The white walls pretty bare except for a small section at&nbsp; the front and leftover decor from some long ago party still hanging from a cross beam. It's quite spacious and little chance of feeling crowded.\n\nOur waiter took our order for starters which came in record time. Some nice options, different from what you usually see in most Indian restaurants. They also cleared our starters in record time. Felt a bit rushed with the waiter hovering while I put the last morsel into my mouth so he could whisk away my plate.\n\nThe menu is quite extensive. Also available is a buffet which I found to have mostly the regular options so we ordered a la carte. The Butter Chicken is admittedly one of the best I have ever had. We had Palak Paneer, Cashew Chicken and&nbsp;Lamb Madras with heaps of Garlic Naan. It's a pity that Indian restaurants don't serve some kind of veg or side as part of the meal like most other restaurants do. If you want a side you need to order another main veg dish. Makes the meal pretty expensive overall. The food was quite good. But I would say that for the general ambience they're a bit overpriced. Their prices range on the same scale as <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bukhara.com\/frameset_2.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Bukhara<\/a> or Annapurna, and both of these have a whole lot more atmosphere and vibe than Taj Mahal.\n\nOne of the drawcards is that they have an area allocated for Namaaz at the back of the restaurant. The downside to this though is that people use the rest rooms for Wudu which leaves the place a bit messy. This does not need to be a problem if the management ensures that the toilets are cleaned timeously but this was not the case on the night that we were there. Men's room floors were wet and messy. It may be better to arrive with wudu if you'll be needing to make namaaz.\n\nThey're definitely a family restaurant so child friendly. But not in a Spur way, just casual and easy. In my opinion, a pretty average experience. It's unlikely I'll want to drive all the way to Hout Bay for a visit considering there are plenty of great Indian restaurants much closer. But it's good to know there are options on that side of the world.","post_title":"Taj Mahal, Hout Bay","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"taj-mahal-hout-bay","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2022-01-26 23:16:59","post_modified_gmt":"2022-01-26 21:16:59","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/?post_type=listing&#038;p=361","menu_order":0,"post_type":"listing","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},{"ID":741,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2015-06-29 16:57:05","post_date_gmt":"2015-06-29 16:57:05","post_content":"<p class=\"style5\"><span class=\"style5\">Halaal Accomodation, semi self catering, situated in De Tijger, Parow North, in a luxurious, tranquil upmarket area with breath-taking views, near Plattekloof &amp; Panorama.\u00a0 <\/span>Resident hosts will personally welcome and share their warm villa with you!<\/p>\r\nLayla Villa a modern, elegant double-storeyed building, consisting of 4 bedrooms, 2 balconies upstairs with spectacular view, 1 reception, 1 lounge for relaxation, 2 dining rooms of romantic-style with exclusive furniture, garden with BBQ area, double garage and parking bays outside.\r\n<div class=\"style5\">Cape Town museums, beaches, and other tourists facilities are in close proximity with Cape Town CBD about 20km away.

It's one of the few places still open at 12pm on weekends. So I was quite unprepared for the large families and noisy children screaming down the aisle on a Sunday afternoon.\n\nIn fairness, the venue is small and intimate. It is literally a vintage train compartment converted into a coffee shop.\n\nWhile diners have the semblence of privacy while seated in their individual booths it's pretty hard to keep a conversation private. The space is spare and sound carries quite easily.\n\nSo the kids in any other venue may not have been as loud as they were in the train. I imagine that the crowd is generally more of the surrounding businesses and flats during the week. It's quite popular also as a tourist destination.\n\nThe&nbsp;Train is&nbsp;kind of a landmark in Cape Town. So it's not surprising anymore to be driving down the road and suddenly spot a train compartment off its tracks amid the hustle and bustle of Sea Point. The exterior is looking a bit worse for wear and could use a little sprucing up.\n\nThe interior looks exactly as I remember it from back then. The same blue velvet upholstered booths, (freshly re-upholstered), antique looking tulip lamps over each table, real wood window frames and brass finishes. It still looks authentic.\n\nThe menu has been substantially expanded and offers breakfast, light lunches and some decent main meals. It does have a bit of an Indian slant with Prawn Chaat and Mutton Salomies on offer.\n\nWe had sandwiches, a pretty decent steak sarmie on white and chicken, macon and mozzarella on wholewheat.\n\nPrices were reasonable, even cheap but service left alot to be desired. Our waiter was surly and while efficient, did not smile once. He even had words with another waitress in full view of the patrons which I thought to be pretty unprofessional.\n\nIt seems popular among families as another large family was seated after we came in, so I would say it's pretty child friendly.\n\nThe large dessert menu would also help.&nbsp;It's no Spur though and space is limited. I also don't remember seeing any toilet facilities but I did not ask and there probably are some.\n\nI'd like to give it another shot at a different time of the week to see what the vibe would be. But's it's cool if you want uncomplicated and casual.\n\nReviewed June 2015","post_title":"Atlantic Express Cake & Coffee Train, Sea Point","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"atlantic-express-cake-coffee-train-sea-point","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2019-05-12 23:47:17","post_modified_gmt":"2019-05-12 23:47:17","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/?post_type=listing&#038;p=682","menu_order":0,"post_type":"listing","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},{"ID":675,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2015-06-19 12:05:12","post_date_gmt":"2015-06-19 12:05:12","post_content":"HOUSE REVIEW:\n\nBeing situated on the grounds of the <a href=\"http:\/\/islamia.co.za\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Islamia College<\/a> in Lansdowne, I wasn't sure of what to expect from this restaurant. Driving into the secure parking lot onto the grounds of Islamia College I was captured by the impressively vast and modern architechture of the institute.\n\nWe were meeting a group of my cousins here for breakfast but I wasn't sure how relaxed the restaurant vibe would be, it being on the grounds of a renowned Islamic Centre after all. I found myself checking that I had my scarf on my head before I got out of the car. We headed upstairs to the restaurant. Luckily there is also an elevator, which we needed to lug our pram and baby paraphanalia along too. We were greeted by about 40 of my cousins who had happily and noisily taken over one half of the restaurant.If I was worried about vibe, I was worried for nothing.\n\nThe restaurant is modern and elegant but quite relaxed and accomodated my gregarious family along with more than a few busy toddlers with grace. We had made a block booking with a buffet breakfast for our group. They had set up several tables for us on one side of the venue and provided their normal tables for other patrons on the other side.\n\nI must admit, I may have found it a tad noisy to have been a normal patron on that day. Breakfast was a good variety of hot and cold dishes. There was so much to choose from I wish I had been hungrier. The coffee and tea was topped up regularly and waiters were constantly available to tend to us.\n\nOur set menu cost us R100 per person and I thought it was great value for what we got. There was also live music in the form of a guitarist who I understand is no longer there. Not sure if they can arrange someone else for your function but definitely worth the ask.\n<div class=\"separator\">I had a squizz at the normal menu and they have a good variety of sandwiches, light meals, mains and desserts at very reasonable prices. Even the steak burger was only R45. I found only that the grills were a bit pricey compared to the rest of the menu. They have meal options for kids and are suitable for the whole family. However they don't offer baby chairs.<\/div>\nThe venue is a good option for small functions and even business meetings. The surrounding buildings also provide a library, auditorium and a Mosque on the grounds.","post_title":"Alhambra, Lansdowne","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"alhambra-lansdowne","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2019-06-10 19:31:24","post_modified_gmt":"2019-06-10 19:31:24","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/?post_type=listing&#038;p=675","menu_order":0,"post_type":"listing","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"3","filter":"raw"},{"ID":648,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2015-06-17 16:11:22","post_date_gmt":"2015-06-17 14:11:22","post_content":"HOUSE REVIEW:\r\n\r\nPearl Spoon is a suave and tasteful venue for light meals, brunches with the girls, and tea time treats.

The decor is glam and upmarket and the food is equally well presented.\r\n\r\nUpon entering the restaurant you are greeted by a beautifully arranged table of desserts, cakes and sweet treats. It sets the tone for wondering what you'll have after your meal cos it's fairly difficult to forget once you've set your eyes on it. There is a nook with couches and armchairs and sparkly chandeliers festoon the ceiling. The sounds of easy jazz fill the air as you are seated in the unusually busy for a week morning but obviously popular little venue.\r\n\r\nThe restaurant is situated on Belvedere road right next to the Caltex garage but I must admit it was easy to miss. I drove right past it and had to phone to ask where they were. They are next to the Snoekies, which is easier to spot on Belvedere road.\r\n\r\nWe ordered speciality drinks, an orange, carrot and ginger juice and a pomegranate, tea and soda concoction. Both were delicious, on the eye and on the tongue. The scrambled egg and salmon croissant and the honey mustard chicken with avo and macon on sourdough arrived fairly quickly after our drinks. Service was slick and we didn't wait long at all. The meals were so pretty on the plate it was almost a shame to tuck in and upset this little piece of art. None of their more interesting open sandwiches are served warm though. And the warm toasteds are pretty standard fair. A nice touch on the table was tiny little holders of coarse black pepper and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.maldonsalt.co.uk\/Products-Maldon-Sea-Salt-Flakes.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Maldon salt<\/a> with you guessed it a tiny little Pearl Spoon to sprinkle with.\r\n\r\nThe meals are mostly light and fresh and include ingredients like Free Range Chicken and Buffalo Mozzarella. Prices are not bad. Both our meals were in the R75 range but prices start at about R25 for basic breakfasty stuff to R80 for a Sirloin steak with fries, cheaper than the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.spur.co.za\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Spur<\/a> methinks. Our drinks were in the R30 range.\r\n\r\nWe chased our meals with excellent coffee and took a piece of chocolate cake as a takeaway. The cake was moist, dark and rich, truly divine and I certainly plan a trip back for a sample of something else from the dessert spread.\r\n\r\n<b>The Details: <\/b>Halaal Certified","post_title":"Pearl Spoon, Claremont","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"pearl-spoon-claremont","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2019-03-28 14:00:01","post_modified_gmt":"2019-03-28 14:00:01","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/?post_type=listing&#038;p=648","menu_order":0,"post_type":"listing","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"7","filter":"raw"},{"ID":628,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2015-06-15 14:55:48","post_date_gmt":"2015-06-15 12:55:48","post_content":"<span class=\"st\">HOUSE REVIEW: <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"st\">Eastern Food Bazaar is located in the old Wellington Fruit Growers Building that stretches <\/span><span class=\"st\">between Loop and Darling Street in Central Cape Town. <\/span>It's a bustling canteen-style eatery perfect for a quick lunch stop or a casual supper. As the name suggests, they do predominently eastern food.\u00a0Tuck into typical North Indian Curries, Tandoor dishes, Chinese, Shwarmas, Falafel, Punjabi and my personal favourite the Chicken Masala Dosa which is a crispy savory pancake from South India filled with spicy chicken and cheese and served with a side of dhal and sambal and various sides and sauces you can help yourself to. It's easy to eat, tasty, huge and filling and at R25 your pocket will be smiling.\u00a0In fact, the prices are one of the reasons Eastern food Bazaar is so popular. You can get a full meal for as little as R20 for a Bean Bunny Chow to R35 for Butter Chicken.\r\n\r\nTreat yourself to a lassi or ice-cream from the ice-cream corner. I find the food generally a bit mild for Indian food but it's always tasty. Perhaps they've tailored it to the largely corporate customers they get from the CBD.\u00a0The system is simple. Walk the passage and drool at the array of choice you're faced with. Be careful of the lunch and supper rush as it can get difficult to get close to the counters then.\u00a0Make your choice and order at the till. Collect your food at the relevant counters and enjoy.\u00a0Seating is available downstairs and upstairs. I'm told that it's a bit quieter upstairs if you prefer.\u00a0If you're eating with your hands (Indian style) there is a wash basin downstairs to wash up when you're done. Toilets are also available downstairs.\r\n\r\nThe Eastern Food Bazaar offers catering for corporate &amp; private events in their own private venue above the restaurant. This upmarket venue is capable of seating 80 - 100 people.\u00a0For events larger than 20 people a booking is required as the demand for this venue is high.","post_title":"Eastern Food Bazaar, Cape Town CBD","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"eastern-food-bazaar-cape-town-cbd","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2022-01-26 22:55:07","post_modified_gmt":"2022-01-26 20:55:07","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/?post_type=listing&#038;p=628","menu_order":0,"post_type":"listing","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},{"ID":626,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2015-06-15 14:34:56","post_date_gmt":"2015-06-15 12:34:56","post_content":"HOUSE REVIEW:\r\n\r\nAs the name implies this venue is pretty much a casual diner.

Serving delicious bakes, meals and coffee in a bright new venue. Find our original review from their previous iconic location below.\n\nHOUSE REVIEW:\n\nIsn't it great when you discover that little hole in the wall that turns out to be a hidden diamond. Dolce Bakery turned out to be just that. I'd come across them on the internet while doing my online stalking of new places to try and decided to pop in as I was in the area for a meeting. The crazy traffic snarl on the N1 made me so late for everything that instead of being able to sit down and try the venue properly I was reduced to a rushed takeout partly eaten in the car before my meeting. Do not ask me how I managed to eat pizza while driving...\n\nDolce does not look like much. In fact, when I stopped in front of it I was wondering if this place was worth the trip. It's located in a kind of industrial part of town, Lower Main Road Obervatory, opposite Woolworths Financial Services. The guy hammering down the paving with a jackhammer next door did not help either. They have 3 or 4 tables outside, just off the road, and a bar counter inside. It's not a fancy kind of place, more like what you'd find at a weekend festival. Casual and functional. So no expectations before I walked in, and then as I stepped through the door the heavens opened and light shone on the bakery cabinet and I heard the angels hummm...\n\nBut I was strong. Being pressed for time and knowing I could not buy a dessert takeaway which would melt in the car while I was in my meeting I ordered a Prego Chicken Pizza, a large pizza for R39!! Where do you buy pizza for R39?!? And a homemade ice tea. I had the ice tea while I waited for the pizza, it was excellent, and when the pizza came 10 minutes later I just had to try one piece before rushing off. To my surprise it was a beautiful thin crust base, crispy and light just the way I like it.\n\nI rushed off with great regret but not before confirming with the staff that they are open on a Saturday till 2pm and pretty busy at that. I expect it's from people in the know who are keeping this little secret, well a secret. So the next time I go to the Biscuit Mill which is nearby and I get tired of elbowing the crowd out of the way to buy some food I'll just slip out and get some lunch down the road instead.\n\nBesides, I so have to go back for dessert...\n\n<em>First Reviewed June 2015<\/em>","post_title":"Dolce Bakery, Observatory","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"dolce-bakery-observatory","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2023-03-29 23:42:29","post_modified_gmt":"2023-03-29 21:42:29","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/?post_type=listing&#038;p=589","menu_order":0,"post_type":"listing","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},{"ID":584,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2015-06-15 09:36:53","post_date_gmt":"2015-06-15 07:36:53","post_content":"Spice it up in Goodwood takes us to the boerewors side of the Boerewors Gordyn. Spice it Up is a relative newbie, and to be fair can hardly be called iconic as it's just not been around long enough. But it is one of the few decent halaal takeouts that are open late-ish and serve a\u00a0 variety of food of a good standard. Right next door is their adjoining spice shop, one of the few in the Northern Suburbs.\r\n\r\nThe takeout menu has all the usual suspects, from Gatsby's and Burgers to Pizzas and grills. One thing they have that you don't get everywhere else is a grill platter with a chicken or beef skewer or fillet served with chips and a pita. The seasoning they use on the chips and pita is specific to them and makes the taste unique. They have good pizzas. I particularly like their Moroccan which has char grilled bbq chicken with pepperdews and they make an awesome Garlic Chita.\r\n\r\nI've had their Steak Gatsby with perinaise and while I'm not a Gatsby afficianado it was quite good. I've heard people say though that their Gatsby's need to be served with slap chips rather than the\u00a0 style of chips that they usually make which is crispier. Their double hotdog is great too and I always order it with perinaise. It's become my go to place for this, my comfort \/ lazy friday night food because it's proximity makes it easier than going all the way to Wembley. A decent 7 on the HFH hotdog meter.\r\n\r\nThe spice shop next door sells everything from large Indian pots and gas cookers to a big variety of spices, rice and even frozen savouries. You can even get your Puri and Patha here. They also have their own range of packaged spices and masalas. The owner tells me they pack and import their spices direct from India so it's more pure and less blended than many that you get here. I haven't really seen much Indian vegetables though.

Anyone who has ventured that way will know the challenge it presents. The tiny store with it's narrow aisles is always busy even on quiet weekday mornings. The smells of spices is thick and the jostling for space can get quite intense. But for the sake of my Mum, who always gets her spices and baking goods for her home and business, we braved the madness. I once went there just before Ramadaan, and it was like being at a packed concert shoulder to shoulder with throngs of people inching ahead one step at a time. Never, and I mean never, make the mistake of forgetting something and have to back-track to find it. It's like starting from scratch.\n\nAn hour later we emerged to find ourselves ravenous and ready for lunch. There are so many places in Gatesville and Rylands, which is the largest Indian area in Cape Town, to get something to eat so we were spoiled for choice. Being close to Gatesville Medical Centre, we decided to try a Bangladeshi place very nearby. I had once bought some take-outs from Cape to India and was very happy with the food. So this time we decided to try out the restaurant itself.\n\nThe location is right behind Gatesville Medical Centre, in the hub of the shopping district. Parking is somewhat limited and I had to circle a bit before I found a spot. It's a very simple, no frills kind of place. It makes me think of homely restaurants I can remember from my trip to India when I was little. On the outside you might miss the <b>Cape to India<\/b> signage but there is a big sign above it that says <b>Bismillah Restaurant<\/b>. They are part of a group that goes by that name.\n\nThe tables are already set, glasses and cutlery ready and plates overturned as if they've been expecting you to pop in. There's always several young Bangladeshi guys hanging around the counter and while it looks very casual and laid back they're always quick to tend to you. We were seated amidst a small handful of other patrons and offered a menu which turned out to be quite extensive.\n\nWhile the place is small, the tables are quite tight and could seat a fair amount of people. You would be very close to your neighbour though. Thankfully it was a bit early and there was no lunch crowd. They also have a Namaaz room available. Our waiter was somewhat brusk. It's not the kind of place where you're going to get 5 star service, more like 2,5 stars but I had no expectations and didn't mind that he wandered off to tend to someone else when he could see I was still hemming and hawing over the menu.\n\nThey serve Indian, Pakistani and Chinese cuisine. We tried the Chicken Manchurian Sizzler, served on a hotplate, which we decided to share and it was enough for the both of us. It was quite sweet which I wasn't expecting but tasty and enjoyable. We also had the Prawn Rosoiz starter which is a Portuguese savoury. It's what we know as halfmoons is originally based on. I think it was very thin on the prawns though and at just one for R15 I think it was overpriced.\n\nThe garlic naan which we had with the Chicken was excellent. I can't say I've had better naan anywhere else. I've had their Panir Palak, which is Indian cheese in a Spinach Curry before and found it very tasty. And their Falooda is a feast for the eyes. Their curries range from R48 to R99. Their grills start at R32 for 1\/4 Chicken Tandoori to R80 for 3pc T-Bone Steak to R240 for a Family Combo. Chinese Dishes include Sweet and Sour chicken, beef or prawn , Chop Suey and Chow Mein dishes and start at about R60. You can even get a Toasted steak sandwich or Viennas and chips parcel. They're a bit lacking on the desserts side with only Rassmalai as a real option.\n\nI would say it's good for a quick stop with decent Indian food but even better to buy it to take home, dress it up and pretend you made it yourself.\n\n<b>The Details: <\/b>Halaal Certified","post_title":"Cape to India Restaurant, Gatesville, Cape Town","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"cape-to-india-restaurant-gatesville-cape-town","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2022-01-26 22:46:05","post_modified_gmt":"2022-01-26 20:46:05","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/?post_type=listing&#038;p=574","menu_order":0,"post_type":"listing","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"1","filter":"raw"},{"ID":563,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2015-06-15 09:08:49","post_date_gmt":"2015-06-15 07:08:49","post_content":"HOUSE REVIEW:\r\n\r\nI first came across Eric Labuschange at the Willowbridge Slow Market about 6 years ago where a decadent looking brownie lassoed me with invisible rope and pulled me over, crying come on over, you know you want me. As I enquired about the brownie the lady at the table pushed forward this fresh faced 16 year old and proudly told me that he was the evil genius behind this devilish concoction. It is truly the best brownie I have ever tasted.\r\n\r\nEric Labuschange started young from his parents kitchen. He was always to be found at the weekend markets and 6 years later he has a factory in Stellenbosch, and has opened a kiosk in Canal Walk, with plans underway to open another at the V&amp;A.\r\n\r\nI was thrilled recently when I was at Canal Walk and walked past this new kiosk selling gorgeous Brownies and Macaroons. But what caught my eye was the Rocky Road slice. It's that powdery one in the middle. Crammed with Marshmallows, Macadamia Nuts and Cherries, it has become my favouritest treat from Yummi Chef. I never leave the mall without a quick stop to pick up a slice.\r\n\r\nThere are about 15 flavours of brownie. Choosing is not easy, trust me. Think Dulce de Leche which is home made caramel and cinnamon or Peanut butter mousse with honeycomb, or Cranberry and macadamia nut nougat. See, not easy at all. A slice will set you back from about R30.\u00a0Macaroons are in the region of R10 each.\r\n\r\nYummi's products are all made from high quality ingredients which are sourced locally where possible. Sustainability is one of their major concerns, and therefore one of their favourite ingredients used in almost every single product, chocolate, is certified <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fairtradelabel.org.za\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fairtrade<\/a> and made from organic cocoa beans.\r\n\r\nAll their products are also gluten and wheat free, allowing for the enjoyment by individuals that are intolerant to gluten or have wheat allergies as well. The factory in Stellenbosch is certified halaal and supplies their outlets. The canal walk store is in the process of getting it's certification. And they have an exciting new product they are developing for the retail market. A gelatine free Marshmallow which will be a first for SA.\r\n\r\nThey supply for events such as birthdays and weddings and supply restaurants and coffee shops.

Recently I'd been hearing of how they've changed their menu and have more of a focus on grills and steaks compared to the coffee shop fare they had started out with. Even back then I felt they had a lot to offer for a coffee shop, so when I was invited to revisit the District Cafe by the owner Sharfudien Parker and his wife Rahima, I was keen to try out the menu I'd been missing out on for so long.\n\nSituated high up on Roodebloem road almost up to the N2, you may be forgiven for thinking you had passed it by. Signage is a bit understated but you'll spot them in a brown building on the corner before the N2 off ramp. The decor is casual and not much has changed from 2 years ago. They have added another section to the restaurant though. The adjoining room could use a bit of the decor touches from the front section but the extra space is a blessing when they are busy. It's also a good space to host a small group for a party.\n\nOn arrival we unexpectedly ran into some family members. We joined the party and filled up the comfy booth in the corner. The big storefront windows allows in a lot of light in the daytime and you can look out onto the passing trade and traffic. The big counter houses some yummy desserts and several people were in and out to collect take outs as well.\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/IMG_9907.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-4530\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4530\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/IMG_9907.jpg\" alt=\"District Cafe Hungry for Halaal\" width=\"610\" height=\"458\"><\/a>\n\nOur waiter was attentive and recommended the Chef's Platter as it would give us the chance to try a bit of all the grills on the menu. I wasn't really in the mood for meat so I opted for the Prawn Pesto Florentine pasta. The Steak Fillet Burger&nbsp;nearly made me reconsider - Basted Fillet steak with greens, tomato, red onion, roasted nuts &amp; mustard sauce. I'd not had roasted nuts on a burger before and was keen to try but I talked myself out of it deciding I would save it for next time. We ordered chicken nuggets and chips for the little guy which came out quickly before our order. While we waited for our mains we sampled the Strawberry and Mint Crush and the Refreshing Mint Lemon Breeze from their mocktails menu. They were both delicious but the Mint Lemon Breeze was the bomb. Their juices are all the fresh pressed variety from Sir Juice. Fresh pressed is always a challenge with small children as they don't like the texture. Would be great if they included some smooth and simple juices for the littlies.\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/IMG_9904.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-4529\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4529\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/IMG_9904.jpg\" alt=\"District Cafe Hungry for Halaal\" width=\"610\" height=\"458\"><\/a>\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/IMG_9903.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-4528\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4528\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/IMG_9903.jpg\" alt=\"District Cafe Hungry for Halaal\" width=\"610\" height=\"458\"><\/a>\n\nOur food arrived and the platter of meat was both a carnivore and banter's dream. A selection of steak, chops, sausage and ribs basted in their special sauce with a side of chilli beans. My prawn pesto pasta was generous and tasty but paled in comparison to the hearty grill platter. The meat was succulent and the basting unique, bbq with a spicy kick without tasting like masala. I'm quite fussy about sausage. And won't easily order a dish that contains sausage, but at last, I had found a sausage that was truly good. Sharfu would not give away his supplier though, no matter how nicely I asked. Suffice it to say the grill platter had to be shared.\n\nPrices are reasonable, my pasta was R79 and the mountain of meat is on special for R189. Their 200g fillet steak is R120, which is the cheapest I've seen lately, and their burgers start at R47 and come with fries or salad.\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/IMG_9908.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-4531\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4531\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/IMG_9908.jpg\" alt=\"District Cafe Hungry for Halaal\" width=\"610\" height=\"458\"><\/a>\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/IMG_9911.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-4532\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4532\" src=\"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/IMG_9911.jpg\" alt=\"District Cafe Hungry for Halaal\" width=\"610\" height=\"458\"><\/a>\n\nThe rest of our party also enjoyed grilled chicken fillets and a light grill platter which contained chicken skewers, beef olives and a crumbed cheese and chicken croquette that was served with cheese sauce. I like the chopped salad that came with some of these dishes topped with flaked almonds and sesame seeds. My aunt's&nbsp; rump steak was slightly too well done (which the owner immediately offered to replace). She was also banting and requested a coleslaw, which was not on the menu, but they made a plan a whipped one up especially. It's this kind of touch that keep their customers coming back.\n\nWe had taken home a slice of carrot cake and baked cheesecake with a toffee caramel topping. Late that night we sat sampling it on the couch when T had finally gone to sleep. Both were really good. The carrot cake moist with a hint of spice but the cheesecake was really excellent. The texture&nbsp; creamy and smooth without being dry as baked cheesecakes sometimes can get. I swear I could practically hear the calories popping on around my waist but I didn't really care... pass me the other slice....\n\nOn chatting with the owner earlier the evening, I found there is an obvious commitment to serving good quality food. While the District Cafe is not fine dining, he is very particular about the standard of the menu. I find there to be interesting items on the current menu and he tells me they are in the process of producing a new menu. This will feature most of the existing one but with a new look and feel and some new additions. Some signage and branding changes can be expected in the very near future as well so you're less likely to miss them and end up on the N2, like I almost did ????. I don't know why it took me so long to go there after the first time. It certainly won't take that long again. That Steak fillet burger is calling my name....\n\nThey are now also open on Friday nights and Saturdays but closed on Sunday.\n\n<em>UPDATED REVIEW: 11 December 2016<\/em>\n\n<em>This is a sponsored post as I was invited by the owner. All opinions are expressly my own.<\/em>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHOUSE REVIEW:\n\nWoodstock, a place that 10 years ago was so grungy and scary, you would have thought twice about going there to shop let alone eat out. It has since undergone quite a facelift and is still in the process of being re-vamped and beautified. Don't get me wrong, the lower side of main road is still pretty scary but above that it's really starting to look quite pretty.\n\nDistrict Cafe is located high up on Roodebloem road right opposite the well known and well loved Dom Pedro's. Woodstock is generally quite artsy and eclectic and it was nice to take in the vibe again. We parked just off Roodebloem outside Dom Pedro's. They had done up one of the outside walls with historical photo's of Woodstock in distressed wooden frames. It was a lovely display and I must admit to being pleasantly surprised that the frames hadn't been stolen right off the wall. Things must really be improving. Forgive my cynicism. I used to work in Woodstock many years ago and petty crime was rife back then.\n\nWe went into the restaurant which is run by 2 sisters. They had converted a superette that had been in their family for many years to a trendy and crisp coffee shop and restaurant. It's not very big and can accommodate maybe 30 people. The decor is quite neutral and seating is comfortable in the iconic plastic chairs and comfy scatter cushions on the booth seating against the window. It's great for a casual breakfast, quick coffee, business meeting or light lunch and they are open for dinner too on the weekends, but closed on Sundays\n\nI had chicken pasta in a napolitana sauce that had a hint of curry. It was quite enjoyable and I polished off the generous portion. My hubby's steak and mustard wrap though is what I would go back for. It was excellent and came with a side of fries. The cappucinos we had were excellent and came complete with a perfect flower and heart on top of the foam. The barista is definitely well trained. The menu is not huge but it's interesting like the Chicken and Pineapple Wrap with avo, pineapple, tomato and cheese served with cranberry sauce or the District Light\u2026Lighter Meal with Beef Olives and Chicken Skewers served with sauce.\n\nPrice-wise I found them very reasonable. My pasta was generous and only R50 and their Steak Fillet burger is only R40. They also have lunch specials which change on a daily basis.\n\nIt's a pretty casual place and I'd say they're quite child friendly as well. They even have Coco Pops as an option on their breakfast menu but I forgot to ask if they keep baby chairs. I'd like to try them again on a weekend, maybe for dinner. I'm sure the vibe would be quite different then. Definitely a do again.\n\nReviewed January 2015","post_title":"District Cafe, Woodstock","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"district-cafe-woodstock","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2020-09-30 15:57:49","post_modified_gmt":"2020-09-30 15:57:49","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/?post_type=listing&#038;p=541","menu_order":0,"post_type":"listing","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"4","filter":"raw"},{"ID":530,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2015-06-11 10:11:30","post_date_gmt":"2015-06-11 08:11:30","post_content":"HOUSE REVIEW:\r\n\r\nRun by two generations of the Osman family in the historic Malay quarter of Bo-Kaap, Biesmiellah has been serving the local Cape Muslim community and, increasingly, tourists for 40 years.\r\n\r\nIt's where you go when you want a taste of home, that quintessential \"huiskos\" that sometimes is the only thing that will satisfy. The restaurant business seems to be in this family's genes as the popular Lounge on Kromboom is owned by Mr Osman's son Showkat.\r\n\r\nBiesmiellah is a simple place. It's like going home to mom's kitchen. The restaurant has been recently revamped and looks neat and cosy. The wood panelling and large Rakams (Islamic art) on the wall really make you feel like you're in a diningroom in Rylands. There's talk of expanding in the near future as the tourist trade keeps them quite busy and sometimes the place is just too small.\r\n<div class=\"separator\"><\/div>\r\nWe were served by an energetic older waitress who has been with the family for almost 15 years. On our request she made recommendations from the menu and promptly told my husband that she would bring him a falooda made with syrup that Mr Osman had returned with from India. She was so charming we didn't mind at all being told what to drink. Just like at mom's.\r\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\">We were served Sugarbeans with Lamb curry, Kebab(meatball) curry, Saffron rice and roti. Salad, pickles and sambals were all complimentary. This was quite refreshing as it's common practice in most Indian restaurants to order these as extras where we are used to it as standard fare that accompanies every meal at home. Both dishes had a bite although I found the kebab curry the tastier of the two.There were lots of the classic Malay dishes on the menu like Denningvleis, Bobotie, and the sweet and sour Pienang curry along with more Indian dishes like Butter Chicken, Mutton Kalya and Akni.<\/div>\r\nIt's really all you can wish for if you're craving a taste of your Cape Muslim home. Service was efficient and friendly in a few frills but cosy atmosphere. I'd definitely go there again!\r\n\r\n<b>The Details: <\/b>Halaal - Muslim Owned","post_title":"Biesmiellah, Cape Town CBD","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"biesmiellah-cape-town-cbd","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2022-01-26 23:00:07","post_modified_gmt":"2022-01-26 21:00:07","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/?post_type=listing&#038;p=530","menu_order":0,"post_type":"listing","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"1","filter":"raw"},{"ID":488,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2015-06-09 10:38:18","post_date_gmt":"2015-06-09 08:38:18","post_content":"Woodies have closed their V&amp;A Waterfront branch and are now trading from their Claremont banch. The review below is of the V&amp;A branch but the food offering is the same.\r\n\r\n<strong>HOUSE REVIEW:<\/strong>\r\n\r\nI've been hearing about Woodies for some time and happened to find myself at the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.marketonthewharf.co.za\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">V&amp;A Food Market on the Wharf<\/a> located next to the craft market and wellness centre, close to the Portswood parking, about a month ago. I went upstairs where they are located and was faced with a throng of people queueing and clamouring at the various food stalls but predominently in front of Woodies. It didn't help that it was right on lunch time but I thought that if a place was that popular those burgers must really be something else. Note to self, come back soon to sample the madness. Of course not even days later I found out from their Facebook page that they were closed. Not long after that there was talk of re-opening again. So I'm glad to say they are in fact back at the market on the wharf. Still in a bit of a set-up stage but operating and churning out those burgers.\r\n\r\nWe decided to try it out on Heritage day. Not that burgers have much to do with our heritage. Thankfully they were not as busy as the last time and the queue was quite manageable. Their list of burgers is short and sweet and includes only 9 types of burgers and nothing else. They are not allowed to sell any drinks as per the Markets rules so you need to buy your drinks at one of the other vendors downstairs and bring them with you.\r\n\r\nWe ordered a Chilli Burger and a Creamy Mushroom and Green Pepper Sauce burger, both with fries. Took a seat at one of the wooden tables in the cosy food court and waited for them to call my name to pick up the order. They also supply paper plates if you're eating there. Both burgers came with 2 hand-pressed beef patties (or you can opt for chicken), lots of salad, sauce and cheese.\r\n\r\nThe burgers were of the better ones I've had from any fast food place. Loved the Jalapenos on the Chilli Burger but the Mushroom Burger was not nearly as saucy as I was expecting. The fries, served in a styrofoam cup are good if you're in the mood for the \"slap tjips\" variety which sometimes I crave although I generally prefer the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mcdonalds.co.za\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mcdonalds<\/a> variety. Pre-salted and vinegary just like from the local fisheries just thinner cut. I am ashamed to say that although I went there hungry, I was unable to finish my burger. Good food but with a high messy factor. You're going to use the entire stack of serviettes they put in your paper bag. Don't go there on a first date.\r\n\r\nFor what you get it's great value for money. It's a well stacked burger at R45 and R50 respectively with an extra R10 each for chips. Only the Colossus weighs in at R80 but with four patties you're going to need to come with a big hole in your stomach. Also a well priced entry level Cheddar Burger at only R25.","post_title":"Woodies, Claremont","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"woodies-va-market-cape-town","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2019-03-28 13:52:08","post_modified_gmt":"2019-03-28 13:52:08","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/?post_type=listing&#038;p=488","menu_order":0,"post_type":"listing","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"4","filter":"raw"},{"ID":460,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2015-06-09 09:21:32","post_date_gmt":"2015-06-09 07:21:32","post_content":"HOUSE REVIEW:\r\n\r\nIt's 5pm and you can finally turn off your PC, close your files and escape the boss, only to be stuck in traffic for an hour in the oven that has become your car. Finally on the home stretch, you collect baby from daycare and make it into your driveway after dodging the rest of the neighbours all streaming in from their respective offices. It's 6pm and you barely have time to throw together a semi nutritious supper while hubby baths baby and gets him ready for bed. There's no way you're gonna get to watch Egoli tonight. Just too much to still do before bed time....\r\n\r\nDoes this sound like a typical day in your life? I bet you'd love to just get take outs but don't want to compromise on the quality of your food all the time. Especially when you have little ones who need the nutrition that typical fast foods just can't provide. Wouldn't it be great to get healthy home cooked meals that can be delivered to your door? Well now you can. And what's great is that this new little business...is based in the Northern Suburbs where halaal options are sorely limited in the first place.\r\n\r\nCooked Inc. is a breath of fresh air. Started by Mariam Jakoet Harris and barely 2 weeks old it has hit the ground running. Mariam's focus is on providing the best quality, healthy halaal food. She has a weekly menu of lunches and dinners. You order by Friday the week before and she supplies on cue to your house or office the following week. You can order just one or 2 meals or you can take a weekly package for better value.\r\n\r\nMariam was diagnosed with cancer in 2008. After processing the initial shock she became determined that this would not beat her. She started researching the disease and determined that diet was a leading factor in helping to beat it. She read up about food and nutrition and everything in between and put herself on the most healthy and unprocessed diet possible. 6 months later along with her medical treatments, she was cancer free. She has continued with this eating plan and Alhamdullilah, she is still cancer free today.\r\n\r\nThe food on her menu follows the same rigorous standard. The freshest veggies, never frozen unless it's peas, Free range and organic meats as much as possible and hormone free dairy. She doesn't use any styrofoam packaging and all her plastic containers are BPA free. Every dinner comes with something sweet and a healthy snack for those after lunch slumps can be ordered. Raw juices are also available as add ons and Platters for parties and functions.\r\n\r\nMariam was kind enough to offer me a sample of her Thai Green Curry and Cauli Rice. It was my first experience of cauli rice and I couldn't wait to get stuck in. The meal was excellent. The cauli rice was a bit like couscous in texture. I loved it. The Thai curry was flavourful and creamy with just enough zing. I had no carbs with my meal and didn't miss it at all. Some other options include: Chicken and Cucumber Ribbon Salad with a homemade paleo mayo, Roast Chicken and Cannelini Bean Mash with Blanched Green Beans or Keralan Fish Curry and Cauli Rice\/Basmati Rice. She re-invents her menu every week so you'll never get bored.\r\n\r\nYou can expect to pay from R60 for a single meal to R500 for a weekly package for 2 people. It's reasonably priced for the quality of the ingredients and the excellent flavoursa nd it's certainly cheaper than ordering junk food. Delivery within a 10km radius is free and is available further out for a delivery charge.","post_title":"Cooked.inc - Meals to Order, Goodwood","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"cooked-inc-meals-to-order-goodwood","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2019-03-28 13:55:35","post_modified_gmt":"2019-03-28 13:55:35","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/?post_type=listing&#038;p=460","menu_order":0,"post_type":"listing","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},{"ID":440,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2015-06-08 11:18:10","post_date_gmt":"2015-06-08 09:18:10","post_content":"HOUSE REVIEW:\n\nA long drive to Hout Bay usually culminates in a casual seafood lunch. It used to be at the takeaway section at Mariners Wharf, but a few years ago Fish on the Rocks made it's presence known. According to the website it had been started 26 years ago, but it seems it has become very well known and has reached a sort of iconic status in the last 10 years or so. It's situated right on the waters edge and from the back of the store you have a beautiful view over the bay of Chapman's Peak. The short road that takes you to there is flanked by the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hungryforhalaal.co.za\/2014\/12\/markets-in-cape-town-with-halaal-food.html#more\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bay Harbour Market<\/a>. A popular weekend arts and craft market that sees people coming from all over. It's a bit \"arty farty\" and the wares are usually quite expensive but it's gets busy so you'll likely be competing for parking because of it.\n\nUtterly casual and laid back, Fish on the Rocks has no pretenses. You wait in line for your food, pay for foam plates, collect and eat at the wooden tables outside or take it away and enjoy as you please. This place is always busy. More often than not, you will need to share a table with strangers but the vibe is friendly and everyone's enjoying their food too much to give a fig about the stranger that's just plonked herself, her husband and 2 year old at their table.\n\nThe food in general is typical seafood takeout fare. Calamari, fish, prawns and slap chips. The standard is generally quite good. Better than Mariner's Wharf at least who's food has become progressively more oily and the alcohol may put you off at Mariners making Fish on the Rocks the obvious choice.\n\nThe staff tell me they don't have a certificate but are fully halaal as they are Muslim owned by Aziz and Najma Broderick. Yes, the name on the website also threw me off.\n\nThere are toilet facilities available. In general quite clean. A big relief if you're doing the Peninsula drive and need to empty out before taking on the rest of your journey.\n\nRecently we took a Sunday drive out there and ordered hake and chips, calamari and chips and a calamari burger. I was expecting my calamari to look like this:\n<div class=\"separator\"><a href=\"http:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/-XKZqssUA5rM\/VOZBs1GbUxI\/AAAAAAAADO4\/CqdvoMvMB2E\/s1600\/img_6308b.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/-XKZqssUA5rM\/VOZBs1GbUxI\/AAAAAAAADO4\/CqdvoMvMB2E\/s1600\/img_6308b.jpg\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"><\/a><\/div>\nBut it actually looked more like this minus the prawns:\n<div class=\"separator\"><a href=\"http:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/-DF9EV8xd9-U\/VOZBtLB7xJI\/AAAAAAAADO8\/qopk1K8wEaA\/s1600\/Screen%2BShot%2B2015-02-19%2Bat%2B9.36.51%2BPM.png\"><img src=\"http:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/-DF9EV8xd9-U\/VOZBtLB7xJI\/AAAAAAAADO8\/qopk1K8wEaA\/s1600\/Screen%2BShot%2B2015-02-19%2Bat%2B9.36.51%2BPM.png\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"><\/a><\/div>\nThe portion was big though. But my expectation was unrealistic. I was hoping for crispy coated calamari but it was half battered at best and frankly a bit bland. We had to pep things up with Tartare sauce which you buy extra in little sachets. Only tomato sauce was free which you help yourself to at a counter along with plastic cutlery, serviettes, salt, pepper and vinegar. The calamari burger was ok. But came with nothing but calamari, a lot of it. No salads or anything else. The hake was excellent. Crispy and tasty.\n\nTo finish off your seafood lunch you can head over to a little kiosk they have set up for a soft serve ice cream topped with delicious Monin Sauces. We tried the dark chocolate and it was delish. You could also go for an icy slush. I had a strawberry flavour and it was a perfect choice as the day was cooking and the slush was the perfect way to cool off in the car as we headed back home with the scent of the sea air drifting away behind us.","post_title":"Fish on the Rocks, Hout Bay","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"fish-on-the-rocks-hout-bay","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2021-01-07 02:04:29","post_modified_gmt":"2021-01-07 02:04:29","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/?post_type=listing&#038;p=440","menu_order":0,"post_type":"listing","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"1","filter":"raw"},{"ID":412,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2015-06-02 14:38:06","post_date_gmt":"2015-06-02 12:38:06","post_content":"HOUSE REVIEW:\r\n\r\nToday's post is the first in a series of posts about iconic takeaways in Cape Town. Fear not, I will also do a series of the same in Jozi and KZN as well. But for now we kick off with probably the most famous Roadhouse of them all, Wembley Roadhouse in Belgravia road Athlone.\r\n\r\nThis infamous landmark crammed into the tight Southern Suburbs streets has become a destination venue. It's where the young dudes go to show off their pimped rides and where the white girls go with the coloured boys after clubbing till the wee hours and need to feed the munchies. It's where your folks took you on weekends for a takeout treat and where you go now when you have that lussie for something specific like a Wembley Whopper or Falooda Crush that can only be delivered in one place.\r\n\r\nI remember my dad driving us from Stellenbosch when we were little to visit in the South and us stopping at Wembley and without fail he would always order the prawn curry and roti which came carefully sealed in a foil container that would stay hot till we got home, well mostly. We would wait patiently in the car till our order was brought watching the steady flow of cars and patrons coming and going. Nothing much has changed since those many years ago, you pull up, and either wait for a waiter to come to your window and take your order or muscle your way to the front of a busy crowd to place your order at the window. It's no holds barred. If you're gonna stand back and wait, you're gonna get left behind. They're always busy. And the food takes long to prepare. It's not a quick pick-up KFC or Mc'D style. A good option is to phone your order in and just come and collect. You can get the menu online but don't worry, that incandescent and endless pink menu will soon become a staple on your fridge.\r\n\r\nThey're famous for the Wembley Whopper, a confection of steak, braised onions, sliced potatoes, salad and sauce in a bun. Not my personal favourite. I'm partial to the DOUBLE HOTDOG, yes it's capitalised on purpose. It's a sort of comfort food for me. Two very tasty viennas, smothered in chips, seasoning and sauce of your choice on a hotdog roll, always wrapped in foiled paper which means it stays hotter for longer (for that drive home you see). Or if you can't wait, park and eat in your car. It's a roadhouse after all. Added extras like the samoosas and potato waras\/bites always go down well and will fill the gap before you get to your main.\r\n\r\nThe Falooda crush is like drinking dessert. The rose flavoured milk is so thick with ice cream, nuts and jelly pieces that you need a spoon to get through all of it.The note on the new menu adds that they have completed new restrooms adjoining the roadhouse. For Muslim clientele there is also wudu and salaah facilities available.\r\n\r\nI've got to have something as a point of comparision to the other takeout's I'm going to cover. So unapologetically, because I love hotdogs, that's what I'm going to use. I've tried hotdogs from most of the major Halaal takeouts in Cape Town and on my Hotdog meter this is amongst the best of them, a solid 8 out of 10 on the HFH Hotdog meter.\r\n\r\nIf you want to know who's going to beat that you'll have to wait for the next installment of Iconic Takeaways in Cape Town.","post_title":"Wembley Roadhouse, Athlone","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","post_password":"","post_name":"wembley-roadhouse-athlone","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2019-03-28 14:00:08","post_modified_gmt":"2019-03-28 14:00:08","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/?post_type=listing&#038;p=412","menu_order":0,"post_type":"listing","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},{"ID":394,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2015-06-02 14:28:28","post_date_gmt":"2015-06-02 12:28:28","post_content":"HOUSE REVIEW:\n\nSo this week's installment of Iconic Takeaways in Cape Town makes room for my first <a href=\"http:\/\/www.zomato.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Zomato<\/a> Meetup experience. I was invited by Zomato to join their team and fellow bloggers to a dinner at Sabria's in Wynberg. Sabria's is part of Cosy Corner, one of the most popular takeout places in Wynberg. It's been around for some years but has relaunched as a Fine Dining establishment, one of the very few fully halaal fine dining venues in Cape town, about 3 months ago. While I know all about Cosy Corner, I hadn't been to Sabria's yet and was keen to try out this \"fancy\" spinoff from it's grass roots beginnings.\n\nArrival time was 6.30pm. Parking on Ottery main road is a challenge at any given time and I was so lucky to find a space right outside in one of the parking bays across the road. There is also parking available at the Church behind the restaurant and I understand there is usually someone there to watch the cars.\n\nThe decor in the restaurant has been beautifully done. It is chic while still retaining a warmth and excuse the pun, cosiness. Lighting was low and while it is a fine dining venue the atmosphere was still quite relaxed.Our Zomato table was set against the wall with a long bench covered in comfy cushions on one side and chairs on the other.\n\nOur hosts started us on canapes of bruschetta covered in various toppings of roasted vegetables, Camembert cheese, and smoked salmon. While we tucked in, Yousri Hartley, the owner of Cosy Corner and Sabria's, popped over and gave us a little history about the place. Established in 1973, Cosy Corner was one of Cape Town\u2019s first Halaal eateries. It still operates from the very same corner in Wynberg, and is still owned and run by the family who started it.\n\nIt's a family business that also played its part in the apartheid struggle. Once home to artist Jacques Coetzee who fought against apartheid and was harboured there by the family.There was more food than we could possibly get through without ruining our appetite for the many other dishes that were to come.\n\nThe theme of plenty would set the tone for the rest of the meal and we were hard pressed to pace ourselves over each course just so we could sample a morsel of everything. Mains included roti and 2 curries, one of which was a specially prepared dish that had a distinctive spice flavour that I just could not get my finger on. The owner later told me it was prepared by an Indian lady that does that dish specially for them and would not reveal that specific spice to me. Ah well, I'll just have to go back for it then. Vegetables were perfectly done with just the right amount of crunch. The Thai mussel curry was ridiculously good. Could have been hotter but only if you like really hot.\n<div class=\"separator\">Do I even have to say a word about dessert? Chocolate Mud Cake, Layered Chocolate Mousse and my favourite, the one in the middle, Chocolate Hazelnut Mousse with bits of hazelnut in the mousse. I had died and gone to Chocolate heaven.<\/div>","post_title":"Sabria's, Wynberg","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"sabrias-wynberg","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2022-01-26 23:16:22","post_modified_gmt":"2022-01-26 21:16:22","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/?post_type=listing&#038;p=394","menu_order":0,"post_type":"listing","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"6","filter":"raw"},{"ID":385,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2015-06-02 14:11:53","post_date_gmt":"2015-06-02 12:11:53","post_content":"HOUSE REVIEW:\r\n\r\nWant to have dinner with the best view of Table Mountain? Bo Kaap Kombuis will offer you the best view, an authentic Cape Malay eating experience and a full tummy.\r\n\r\nAfter a long meandering drive up Wale street, past Bismillah's pushing my 1400 Polo further and further up the hill hoping not to embarass myself by stalling the car while trying to park, (it's a tad bit steep you see) we finally made it to the impressive restaurant enclosed in glass on 2 sides, set atop a guesthouse with the most amazing view of our famous mountain. A small tip, if you're coming for supper, try getting there while it's still light as you can fully appreciate the view and the proximity of the mountain. After dark the lights over Cape Town are just as wonderful a sight to take in while enjoying your dinner.\r\n\r\nThe vibe in the restaurant was casual and laid back. The focus definitely on a family atmosphere where you can relax and linger over extended meals in their well padded dining chairs.\r\n\r\nThe menu had a few Indian dishes, like Butter chicken and Dhal curry but we decided to try mostly the Malay dishes. The prawn curry was tasty and served with flaky and rich Malay Rotis. The Black Bean curry was mild with an interesting flavour not familiar to my Indian roots. The Butter chicken was just spicy enough and my Bobotie which must be the best known Malay dish in Cape Town was certainly the real deal.\r\n\r\nFor dessert we had coffee and koeksisters. Let me just say that the owner, Yusuf, makes a mean coffee. Just look at this cream coffee. Is it not a dessert all on it's own! I'm not one for koeksisters either, but had to have one for the \"gees\". They were just perfect. Still piping hot, and not the slightest bit oily which is what usually puts me off koeksisters to begin with.\r\n\r\nThe owners, Yusuf and Nazli were both present and having lively chats with locals who seemed to wander in for late meals and coffees. Other tables were occupied with some tourist groups, one sounding quite Russian, that were there to take in real Cape Malay cuizine. Here are Yusuf and Nazli with their team.\r\n\r\nMy cousin was there for breakfast recently and she had rave reviews about the breakfast. This is some of what she had to say:\r\n\"It was actually quite nice. R48 for a normal breakfast consisting of 2 eggs, mushrooms, 2 sausages, grilled tomato, 2 slices of toast &amp; your choice of tea or coffee. While we were there a family of 4 arrived from church &amp; ordered lunch. Then the owner arrived &amp; in tow came a friend of his or a neighbour (about 60 years of age). The neighour proceeded to shoot the breeze with the owner &amp; helping him here &amp; there, passing on this &amp; that &amp; commenting on things in general. I definitely got the authentic Bo-Kaap vibe which was quite enjoyable. A french tour group of about 15 people arrived at 12. They had a booking &amp; a buffet was waiting for them of curries, rotis etc.\"\r\n\r\nI personally attended a birthday party for which the restaurant had been booked out. It was well organised, the buffet was great and they allowed the use of their plasma for the guests to show a movie made for the occasion.\r\n\r\nAs an added bonus there are Salaah facilities available upstairs.\r\nUnfortunately the restaurant is closed on Mondays and for dinner on Sundays.<b> <\/b>\r\nBo Kaap Kombuis is Halaal - The host, Nazli tells me they don't have a certificate but a letter of endorsement from the MJC.","post_title":"Bo Kaap Kombuis, Cape Town Central","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"bo-kaap-kombuis-cape-town-central","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2022-01-26 23:00:17","post_modified_gmt":"2022-01-26 21:00:17","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/hungryforhalaal.co.za\/?post_type=listing&#038;p=385","menu_order":0,"post_type":"listing","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},{"ID":378,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2015-06-02 14:02:12","post_date_gmt":"2015-06-02 12:02:12","post_content":"HOUSE REVIEW:\r\n\r\nThe great Gatsby, humble Hotdog and sublime Salome all come home to roost in this, the Cape Town CBD's most famous and potentially most frequented take-aways. Episode 3 of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hungryforhalaal.co.za\/search\/label\/--Takeaways\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Iconic <\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hungryforhalaal.co.za\/search\/label\/--Takeaways\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Takeaways in Cape Town<\/a> takes us to Miriam's Kitchen, which is legendary for hearty and tasty fair at reasonable prices.\r\n\r\nMiriam's has been around for over 25 years. A family run fast food business that has maintained its standard and innovated to include a second branch that has comfortable seating as well as a Salaah room that caters for their many Muslim customers. There are 2 branches in town, one on St Georges Mall and a second one on Heerengracht street directly opposite <a href=\"http:\/\/www.burgerking.co.za\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Burger King<\/a>. Can't imagine anyone opting for Burger King though if they had to choose.\r\n\r\nMiriam's extensive menu ranges from Burgers, Sandwiches, their famous Gatsby's and Salomies to choices for the not so hungry like Samoosa's, Pies, Koeksisters and Batata Wada's. They even do curry and rice. It's typical Malay and Indian food with a Cape Town twist. It's the kind of place where everyone goes.\r\n\r\nSuits rub shoulders with cut-offs and sneakers. Office workers escape the high rise for a quick lunch or send a colleague to collect the floor's order. Yes, they take phone order's as well. I admit with great shame that even though I am a born and bred Capetonian, I only recently had the Miriam's experience.\r\n\r\nI popped in one afternoon after a meeting in town and true to form opted for my firm take-away favourite, the quintessential double hotdog. Now why it's taken me this long is rather unforgivable (but I hope you'll forgive me) because it is quite simply the best hotdog I have had to date.\r\n\r\nA flavourful spicy vienna and fresh salads makes all the difference. On the HFH hotdog meter it scores a handsome 9 out of 10. Now I don't know if I will ever give a 10 out of 10. Not sure if that's even possible. No one can have everything..... right?","post_title":"Miriam's Kitchen, Cape Town
